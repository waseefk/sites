				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>At Naked Kitchens we are proud of the beautiful resources and natural materials that make our stunning bespoke kitchens and furnishings.</p>
<p>We could not be more delighted to introduce our latest kitchen to our showroom! Located in West Raynham, our new gorgeous showroom kitchen was completed at the beginning of July and has been our pride and joy ever since.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-207" src="https://www.nakedkitchens.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/sites/8/2016/10/ladbrooke-71-1024x683.jpg" alt="ladbrooke-71" width="640" height="427" srcset="https://www.nakedkitchens.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/sites/8/2016/10/ladbrooke-71-1024x683.jpg 1024w, https://www.nakedkitchens.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/sites/8/2016/10/ladbrooke-71-300x200.jpg 300w, https://www.nakedkitchens.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/sites/8/2016/10/ladbrooke-71-768x512.jpg 768w, https://www.nakedkitchens.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/sites/8/2016/10/ladbrooke-71.jpg 1500w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" /></p>
<p><span id="more-205"></span></p>
<p>Our new showroom kitchen is called the Ladbroke Kitchen, beautifully bedecked in brass, walnut, and a dark rich green colour.</p>
<p>Our beautiful White Washed Oak is brought to life, creating the perfect feature piece flooring. Its wonderful stone washed aesthetic with pale pink hues gives a suitable burst of colour to brighten any room whilst creating an edgy-urban style, adding a modern twist, the perfect flooring for bolder cabinets and walls.<br />
This gorgeous solid timber flooring brings all the warmth of a pleasing sound when walking over the planks and brings life to any kitchen with a satisfying ring underfoot.</p>
<p>Bringing in a contrasting darker hue we also have displayed our magnificent walnut wall panelling. This striking hardwood has a wavy grainline, its texture enhanced by it colour, a rich chocolate brown with a purple cast. Walnut’s naturally distinctive grain patterns and rich texture gives the kitchen an earthy, majestic and homely characteristic that promotes the feeling of warmth.</p>
<p>Walnut also adds a touch of elegance and practicality with our walnut breakfast bar. This beautifully finished breakfast bar adds depth to the room with a sturdy, useful structure that’s easy to maintain and is very attractive. With its minimalist supports, it has the appearance of a floating surface allowing users to fully appreciate and admire the kitchens décor.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-208" src="https://www.nakedkitchens.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/sites/8/2016/10/ladbrooke-2-683x1024.jpg" alt="ladbrooke-2" width="640" height="960" srcset="https://www.nakedkitchens.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/sites/8/2016/10/ladbrooke-2-683x1024.jpg 683w, https://www.nakedkitchens.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/sites/8/2016/10/ladbrooke-2-200x300.jpg 200w, https://www.nakedkitchens.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/sites/8/2016/10/ladbrooke-2-768x1152.jpg 768w, https://www.nakedkitchens.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/sites/8/2016/10/ladbrooke-2.jpg 1000w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" /></p>
<p>As a crowning glory to the charms of natural wood, our designers also incorporated brass taps and our new handless design, with a bronze splash backs naturally tarnished that reflects natural light back into the room. To top it all off there are honed Carrara marble worktops to bring the dream kitchen into full brilliance.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>One of the questions we get asked most often is this – what is ‘Shaker’?</p>
<p>Historically, Shaker design door &amp; drawer fronts date back to the mid-18<sup>th</sup> century and are the embodiment of simplicity, combined with fine craftsmanship and functionality. Despite their purposeful lack of ornamentation the artistry of the cabinets is their divining charm.</p>
<p><img src="images/slideshow/glass-house/glass-house-1.jpg" alt="Shaker Doors" width="1498" height="1000" /></p>
<p><span id="more-110"></span></p>
<h3>The History of Shaker Style</h3>
<p>The United Society of Believers in Christ’s Second Appearing developed the furniture style early in their history, and even lent their name ‘Shaker Quakers’ to their creations. Believing that a good life should be lived with principles; mainly honesty, utility and simplicity, the Shakers sort to install these morals in every factor of their lives, including the furniture they made.</p>
<p>Being a largely self-sufficient community, the Shakers grew their own food, and maintained all of their needs through personal manufacture and long lasting construction.  Casting aside the ideas of ‘lavish living’, the Shakers believed that all things should be practical, functional and above all, honest. This is reflected highly in their crafting process, as the lack of adornments cuts labour and material costs in the long term for a community who has to forage from only the natural resources around them. Off cuts of wood could be repurposed to create tools or as kindling for the fire, rather than used to embellish an already functioning piece of equipment.</p>
<p>Not only was Shaker&#8217;s principle a practical one, but the community were very invested in their religion, which also played its part in the manufacturing process. Whilst some may well roll their eyes at the notion of an angel descending from heaven to rest in a chair that has been handcrafted, you can begin to understand why shaker furniture embodies the principles it does and why it played so heavily on it style.</p>
<p><img src="images/slideshow/quayside/quayside-10.jpg" alt="shaker wall cabinets" width="1498" height="1000" /></p>
<p>Immigrating to America in 1774 as outcasts for their pious beliefs, this branch of Protestantism found a new beginning in the New World, though sadly were still not safe from prosecution. Led by Mother Ann Lee, the community at its height had over 5000 ‘brothers and sisters’, and was famed for its communal living, equality of the sexes and celibacy.</p>
<h3>The Mastery of Crafting</h3>
<p>As well as being stunningly beautiful the shaker style showcases the skill and craftsmanship behind their manufacturing. Their belief that all things should hold a purpose and be crafted as a testament to God, gave them a magnificent drive to refine their crafting process and to pick only the best materials available.</p>
<p>In the modern world we have machinery and computers to help us with the manufacturing process, but the shaker craftsmen would have used handmade tools and precision of patience to refine their products and create the finished effect.</p>
<p>This crafting process was especially sophisticated for the construction of their cabinetry doors. Using the feature of a 5-piece door front, the Shakers were able to create a beautiful door that was of sturdy construction and of course vastly practical. By making the fronts from two rails, two stiles and a central panel there was little wasted wood whilst maintaining a solid structure that looks amazing. This in turn became their signatory style, the framed panel or Shaker.</p>
<p><img src="images/slideshow/alexandra-park/alexandra-park-7.jpg" width="1498" height="1000" /></p>
<p>Not only was the prospect of adorning the furniture considered a wasteful pastime for practical purposes but it was also in moral conflict with the Shakers Beliefs. Seeing decorations and embellishments as prideful and at its most extreme being a form of deceit, the Shakers shirked from it.</p>
<p>As such no carvings or inlays will be found on traditional, Shaker made furniture. Instead the Shakers kept their furniture in its most simplistic and practical form to display it honestly. Just as a woman would not wear makeup, a cabinet door needed no fine boarders to draw the eye away from the fact that the cabinet was a cabinet, its beauty lying in its functionality and practical nature, “Beauty rests on Utility” – Shaker Maxim.</p>
<h3>Complimentary Colours and Wood Types</h3>
<p>However, when one thinks of a lack of decoration it is easy to imagine that the Shaker community lacked colour all together. Though it is true that the men and women of the community wore modest regiment with an almost uniform design, it is easy to confuse them with the early pilgrims whose black and white collared appeal has becoming signatory to Americas fledgling history. Comparatively, the Shakers loved rich colours for their clothing, and despite their preference for sturdy well wearing garb (they invented the first waterproof material!) they did not live in a greyscale civic.</p>
<p>When it came to their furniture though the Shakers kept their colours limited to a primary palette. Usually preferring to oil their natural wood, they were also known to paint it in red, yellow, green or blue to add a depth to their open plan houses.  Using a variety of natural plants to create their paint and dyes, this created a very earthy tone, allowing for the natural beauty of the wood to shine through and giving the desired contrast to bare white plastered walls.</p>
<p>Cherry wood and maple were the most commonly used in the manufacture of Shaker furniture, being rich in colour, sturdy and in abundance in the locality. These beautiful pieces also look amazing in Oak and Sapele. Keeping with the Shaker traditions of natural material, Oak is a preferred material as it allows for the grain pattern to show even when painted.</p>
<h3>A Modern Twist</h3>
<p>No Shaker household would be complete without everything having its own place, which was why storage took a definitive part in their furniture design. What good was having a table just to eat off of, when the utensils still needed a place to live, hence drawers in the table front. Other common features included a peg rail to hang outdoor garments or even chairs from the floor, chest of drawers and wardrobes that took up entire walls, a variant to a traditional English kitchen dresser.</p>
<p><img src="images/slideshow/raynham/raynham-1.jpg" width="1500" height="1000" /></p>
<p>Here at Naked Kitchens we love the traditional appeal of the shaker style and its timeless design, however we do also love the zest and modern twists of shaker kitchens in the 21<sup>st</sup> Century.</p>
<p>There are a number of ways to spice up your own shaker style kitchen, everything from the colour you choose to paint it, to the handles you fix to the cabinetry and the worktops you choose. At Naked Kitchens we offer the ability to apply aperture beading to your shaker doors to really help the design pop. You can add rebellion to your design with a choice of cornice and a mix up of slab or v-groove end panelling.</p>
<p>Call us today and speak to one of our designers about traditional Shaker kitchens, with or without the contemporary twist.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>You’ve probably heard kitchen designers talk about the kitchen work triangle. But what is it, and is it still relevant? The concept of the kitchen work triangle developed in the 1940s in order to help single cooks working in smaller kitchens maximise efficiency by positioning the most heavily used elements – the cooking, food preparation and storage areas – in close proximity to one another. If you were to draw an imaginary line from point to point, you would create a triangle from sink to cooker to refrigerator that is designed to make the space easy to use without wasting time moving from one end of the kitchen to the other. The idea grew out of Taylorism, which applied scientific thinking to engineering in order to improve economic efficiency and production, and its principles are still used in the design of kitchens large and small.</p>
<div class="pivotx-wrapper"><img class="pivotx-image" title="efficient kitchen design" src="https://www.nakedkitchens.com/blog/images/2016-02/old-mill-3.jpg" alt="efficient kitchen design" /></div>
<p>Read on to find out how the work triangle can make your kitchen easier and more enjoyable to cook in!</p>
<p><span id="more-12"></span></p>
<p><strong>What are the key principles of the work triangle?</strong></p>
<p>Most kitchen designers and architects still apply the same principles of clean, efficient design to residential kitchens todayand, size permitting, the following factors should govern the layout.</p>
<ul>
<li>A full-height cabinet, or kitchen island, should never come between any points of the triangle so the cook’s movement between work centres is not impeded.</li>
<li>The cabinets or any other obstacles should not intersect any leg of the triangle by more than 300mm.</li>
<li>The sides of any leg of the triangle should be between 1.2 and 2.7 metres, with the total of all three sides being between 4 and 8 metres.</li>
<li>Within the triangle, there should be no other traffic flow to ensure the chef can work safely and undisturbed.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>How the work triangle concept can benefit your kitchen</strong></p>
<p>These days our kitchens have become real hubs of family activity and are no longer just where we cook and eat. We’re entertaining friends, working at the kitchen table, the kids are doing their homework or craft projects – larger kitchens might even have a sofa and TV in, as well as additional preparation and cooking areas, so how these extra elements are laid out is important too. The same triangle concept can be applied here by grouping related activities together so the space works for everything that’s going on without one thing getting in the way of any other. You don’t want people traipsing through the main cooking, prep and storage triangle to get to the entertainment area, for example.</p>
<p>There are several main advantages of the work triangle:</p>
<ul>
<li>Cooking in a dedicated space is much easier as there’s enough room to perform specific tasks and everything is conveniently close to hand.</li>
<li>Minimising unnecessary traffic through the cooking space means the cook can get on with preparing meals without distractions.</li>
<li>As mentioned before, different activities can be zoned in order to avoid them interfering with each other: the preparation and cooking area, the dining/working area, and the entertainment area can all be self-contained spaces that contribute to the overall efficiency of your kitchen.</li>
</ul>
<div class="pivotx-wrapper"><img class="pivotx-image" title="kitchen design" src="https://www.nakedkitchens.com/blog/images/2016-02/alexandra-park-15.jpg" alt="kitchen design" /></div>
<p><strong>Incorporating the work triangle into your new kitchen</strong></p>
<p>If you’re about to change your kitchen layout or are starting from scratch, thinking about the work triangle and applying its principles can help you with planning the ideal layout for the various areas. Consider how your kitchen is going to be used: how much space you need for food preparation; where your dining table is going to go; will you have room for a breakfast bar; will there be space for working or for the kids to do schoolwork? Group areas and appliances together by activity in order to maximise efficiency and avoid people bumping into each other if the whole family is using the kitchen at once for different activities.</p>
<p>Ensuring your kitchen is planned with these things in mind will enable you to make the best use of the available space. If you need any help or advice on planning the perfect kitchen, we’ll be happy to share our knowledge and experience with you.</p>
<p>When thinking how to lay out your kitchen, consider the following ideas which can make it easier to cook in your kitchen:</p>
<ul>
<li>Make sure your fridge isn’t too far from the worktop or food preparation area so you can easily get to ingredients quickly and aren’t transporting them up and down the kitchen.</li>
<li>If you are planning on having a breakfast bar, make sure there’s plenty of preparation space elsewhere so that germs aren’t spread.</li>
<li>To make clean-up easier after meals, keep the sink, bin and dishwasher near to each other, again applying the triangle principle but on a smaller scale.</li>
<li>Avoid obstructions within the work triangle, ensuring islands, dining tables or full-height cabinets don’t get in the way of you moving around the triangle when cooking.</li>
<li>Make sure you’ve got plenty of worktop space for chopping and slicing ingredients near to the stove so it’s easier to add ingredients to your dishes without them dropping on the floor.</li>
<li>Think about where your pots, pans and utensils are going to be stored – ideally they’ll be near your stove so you can get at them quickly.</li>
</ul>

<p>Here at Naked Kitchens, we’re experts in marrying beautiful design with practical function. Because all our kitchens are bespoke, we are able to work with the space you have to create a kitchen that works perfectly for you.  To get more advice on how to to plan your kitchen to fit your needs, get in touch!</p>
<p>Below you can find some expert advice from our kitchen designers, on how to create an efficient kitchen space.</p>
<blockquote><p>“A truly bespoke kitchen means that we can manufacture each cabinet to the exact size required to fit within a defined space. This allows for a much more ergonomic flow to a kitchen. No filler cabinets required to fill that awkward gap. Difficult wall shapes, such as pillars, can also be overcome without compromising the resultant kitchen flow, by manufacturing the cabinet with a shallow depth where required.</p>
<p>A very practical end grain butchers block on the work surface above the kitchen bin cabinet works really well to define the food preparation area. After food preparation, waste can simply be scooped into the pull out bin below reducing spillage and mess.”</p>
<p>— <cite>Jayne Everett, Director, Kitchen Designer</cite></p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p>“The importance of the working triangle continues to strengthen as our kitchens become more and more multi-functional. Designing without this in mind can result in an ill-thought lay-out that creates a complicated living and working space rather than the hub of the home that the kitchen has become today. With this key rule in mind, and our made to order cabinetry, we are able to take this rule and expand it, ensuring that every detail is taken into consideration. Your integrated oven placement can be tailored to suit your height for example, or we can design those hard to reach spaces to suit appliances/objects that you want to keep out of the little one’s reach.”</p>
<p>— <cite>Jessie Hacking, Lead Kitchen Designer</cite></p></blockquote>

<p>Every home is different, so it’s important to plan a kitchen tailor made to fit your space.</p>
<p>Measure, measure and measure! The more accurate the measurement, the more precise your bespoke kitchen will be.</p>
<p><span id="more-13"></span></p>
<div class="pivotx-wrapper"><img class="pivotx-image" title="measuring your kitchen" src="https://www.nakedkitchens.com/blog/images/2016-01/measuring-cabinet.jpg" alt="measuring your kitchen" /></div>
<p>Inspiration &#8211; Have a look through magazines, social platforms and begin to get an idea of the sort of kitchens that you like. Look out for features in a kitchen &#8211; as everything is made to order you are not limited to a range. Like that door on one page and that drawer on another? No problem, we can manufacture it.</p>
<p>Familiarise yourself with the different kitchens that we have manufactured previously. What do you like and dislike?</p>
<p>Know your budget! We all have a budget of some description so let us help you keep within this by looking at your cabinetry configuration and style. One kitchen space can be worked into both low and high budgets; it&#8217;s just about being clever with where you put your money.</p>
<p>Know your appliances! Would you like integrated or freestanding? Do you already own your appliances? Appliances can dictate the lay-out of your kitchen and therefore serve as a great starting point. Want a dishwasher or washing machine for example? There’s a good chance it will need to be near your sink for water supply.</p>
<div class="pivotx-wrapper"><img class="pivotx-image" title="kitchen planning" src="https://www.nakedkitchens.com/blog/images/2016-01/essex-kitchen-012.jpg" alt="kitchen planning" /></div>
<p>Think of the bigger picture &#8211; Your kitchen cabinetry will be a focal point to the heart of your home. Begin to think about the colour scheme and how this will tie in with the rest of the room. What colour will be your walls and your furniture for example? and how will this look with the colour of your cabinetry?</p>
<p>Have fun! We are here to make this experience enjoyable for you. Having a kitchen made for you and you alone is a very exciting process. Let your imagination run with ideas and we will be here to lend advice along the way.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Discover why a wooden worktop should be at the top of your spec list for your new kitchen, providing a great looking, hard wearing worktop for years to come!</p>
<div class="pivotx-wrapper"><img class="pivotx-image" title="" src="https://www.nakedkitchens.com/blog/images/2015-12/kicthen-6.jpg" alt="" /></div>
<p>Your kitchen worktop will see a lot of use over the years, so it makes sense to choose a material that not only looks good but is easy to maintain and simple to repair if it becomes damaged or marked. The natural choice is solid wood. Wooden worktops have many advantages over surfaces like granite and corian, which we’ll explore in this article!</p>
<p>A solid wood worktop will add warmth, homeliness and character to your kitchen and, if well-looked-after, can last you a lifetime. Wood has a timeless and welcoming natural rustic beauty that other materials lack, which makes it an ideal choice for both traditional and contemporary kitchen designs. Granite and stone can look stark, soulless and cold in some kitchens. Using wood is a great way to soften the look of a kitchen that is otherwise all white and will add a dramatic accent.</p>
<p><span id="more-14"></span></p>
<p>Wood is environmentally friendly. These days, most wood used for kitchen worktops will come from sustainably-managed forests – ours are FSC certified which means the wood in our worktops respect and protect the local wildlife as well as the rights of workers. Homely oak, luxuriously dark walnut and fresh and light maple can all be used to craft durable worktops and each wood has its own unique characteristics that will add something different to your kitchen.</p>
<p>Even the most careful of us sometimes have mishaps in the kitchen. The beauty of a solid wood worktop is it can be made to look as good as new. Dents can be filled; stains and scuffs can be polished out or sanded down and re-oiled. The whole surface can even be sanded down and varnished a different colour if you want to ring the changes. Drop a knife on a laminated surface or take a chip out of a stone or granite surface and it’s much more difficult and expensive to put right. Oil your wooden worktop regularly and it will reward you with many years of great service.</p>
<p>A solid wood worktop will only look better as it ages, gaining in character and patina as its natural colour deepens. Because it’s a natural material, each one will be unique, with its characterful and distinct grain patterns adding another dimension to your home. And it’s naturally anti-bacterial, too.</p>
<div class="pivotx-wrapper"><img class="pivotx-image" title="" src="https://www.nakedkitchens.com/blog/images/2015-12/anmer-hall-01.jpg" alt="" /></div>
<p>Unlike other materials like granite, corian and quartz, wood doesn’t always need to be templated in advance like more expensive materials need to be, but always have your worktop installed by a professional kitchen fitter to ensure a perfect design, cut and fit. And because wood is easier to work with, it’s ideal for using in more eclectic kitchen layouts, too.</p>
<p>Quality lasts long after the price is forgotten, the saying goes, so always buy the best materials that your budget allows to enhance your kitchen and it will look good long into the future.</p>

<div class="pivotx-wrapper"><img class="pivotx-image" title="modern kitchens" src="https://www.nakedkitchens.com/blog/images/2015-06/white-slab-frameless-blog-2.jpg" alt="modern kitchens" /></div>
<p>If you thought modern and contemporary were one and the same, particularly when talking about design – think again. Put simply, modern design refers to a specific period of time, usually from the 1920s to the 1950s, a period we might actually think of as retro these days, while contemporary design is what’s happening now – a constantly changing entity that can’t be pinned down in the way modern design can.</p>
<p><span id="more-15"></span></p>
<p>When we talk of modern design, or mid-century modern, to give it the name recognised by design historians, we are talking about a movement that embraced clean, unfussy lines and the extensive use of natural materials such as leather, teak and linen. The emphasis was on pared-down forms and the natural flow from indoors to outdoors, with extensive use of large windows and patio doors to create that connection between the interior and the outside world. Floors were often bare, furniture was often raised off the floor to create a feeling of airiness. Many mid-century homes had white walls: all the better to show off the craftsmanship and quality of the rest of the furnishings, though bold graphics had their place too, particularly in eye-catching wallpaper designs. It’s the period we associate with names such as Charles and Ray Eames, George Nelson, Eero Saarinen (famous for the Tulip dining table) and Aalvar Aalto.</p>
<p>Modern kitchens are sleek, streamlined spaces with simple designs, shiny appliances and a distinct lack of clutter – a look that still works well and is popular in kitchens today. You won’t find curves or unnecessary fuss in a modern kitchen. The cabinet doors are frameless, the countertop edges plain. Cork or linoleum floors are the norm.</p>
<div class="pivotx-wrapper"><img class="pivotx-image" title="" src="https://www.nakedkitchens.com/blog/images/2015-12/img_1557.jpg" alt="" /></div>
<p>So we turn to contemporary. And this is where it gets a bit more difficult. By its very nature, contemporary design is changing all the time – it draws influences from other periods and tends to be eclectic with no one look pulling it all together. Indeed, elements of modern design make their way into contemporary design.</p>
<p>Contemporary design is very much about clean lines which is where it overlaps with mid-century modern but there’s an emphasis on comfort in contemporary style – a rejection of the stark look that sometimes characterises modern spaces. Colourful soft rugs, luxurious throws and plump cushions along with other accessories are important elements in contemporary design that you wouldn’t find in modern homes. Individuality takes centre stage in a contemporary home. Furnishings are likely to be more ornate and reflect the owner’s personality.</p>
<p>Open-plan living is a key component in contemporary homes. There is a natural flow between the kitchen, dining and living areas. You’ll find less wood, except perhaps on kitchen worktops, but other materials such as concrete or stone are prevalent.</p>
<p>As you can see, the lines between what constitutes modern and contemporary are often blurred but while a kitchen that incorporates traditional elements from various eras can be contemporary, it cannot be modern as that refers to a static period in time. And because contemporary is ever-changing, with new materials being developed all the time, what is considered contemporary now, won’t be in ten years’ time, but modern will always be modern.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Colours have a major impact on the look and feel of your kitchen. Make sure you choose colours that complement the room with our tips!</p>
<div class="pivotx-wrapper"><img class="pivotx-image" title="" src="https://www.nakedkitchens.com/blog/images/2015-12/oak-painted-kitchen-13.jpg" alt="" /></div>
<p>It may seem like an easy thing to do, but choosing colours for your blank canvas of a kitchen needs careful consideration so that you don’t make a decision you later come to regret. Your kitchen is more often than not the busiest room in your house so it’s important to set a tone that suits everyone. If you’re introducing colour with the paint you choose to put on your walls then that’s an easy fix if you change your mind or decide that perhaps bright yellow wasn’t the best colour to go with your blue cabinets. But if colour is added with expensive appliances and cabinets then you’re looking at a much bigger bill. Here are a few tips that will help you come to the right decision.</p>
<p><span id="more-16"></span></p>
<p>1. Keep things neutral because neutral colours will always stand the test of time. If you also keep your appliances to the usual white or stainless steel, you can then introduce bolder splashes of colour with things that are more easily changed if you fancy a new look: rugs, pictures, curtains, backsplashes and small appliances like kettles, toasters and microwaves. Or you can add interest with coloured tiles and contrasting worktops. You could even consider painting the backs of your cabinets to add colour. This can look really effective in glass-fronted cabinets and is easy to change back to a more neutral colour if the novelty wears off.</p>
<p>2. Consider the lighting. How your kitchen is lit can greatly affect how colours appear. The more natural light you have coming into your kitchen, the truer the colours will look. Dark colours soak up light like a sponge and can make a small room look even smaller, especially at night when the only light source is artificial. If your kitchen is on the small side but you still want to add colour, try just painting an accent colour on one wall to add a bit of drama and interest without making the room feel claustrophobic. Or if you think white cabinets are boring, choose lighter-coloured cabinets that will inject colour without absorbing all the light and making the space feel cramped.</p>
<p>3. Don’t forget about your flooring when you’re choosing your cabinets and worktops. Those three elements will take up the most space and be the biggest expanses of colour, so consider how they will work together before you start introducing colour elsewhere.</p>
<p>4. Get inspiration. Pinterest is a fantastic resource when it comes to finding inspiring ideas and seeing what colour combinations other people have come up with. Try and find kitchens that are a similar size and style to your own to give you a better idea of what might work and what definitely won’t work in yours. Be warned though: you can easily lose hours doing this and end up with serious kitchen envy.</p>
<p>5. Don’t use too many colours. You don’t want your kitchen to end up looking like an explosion in a paint factory. By sticking to a palette of one or two colours, you can create a sophisticated look that won’t look dated. Choose grey cabinets, for example, and maybe have your island painted a different colour to make a feature of it. If you’re not confident about which colours work best together then buy a colour wheel to help you or talk to your installer.</p>
<div class="pivotx-wrapper"><img class="pivotx-image" title="" src="https://www.nakedkitchens.com/blog/images/2015-12/ball-2.jpg" alt="" /></div>
<p>In conclusion, pick colours you love. You have to live with your choices every day, so go with a palette that will make you happy every time you walk into the room.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Choosing the right kitchen layout is essential to make best use of the space, turning your kitchen into a functional and fun room to be in. Learn more here&#8230;</p>
<div class="pivotx-wrapper"><img class="pivotx-image" title="" src="https://www.nakedkitchens.com/blog/images/2015-12/img_1559.jpg" alt="" /></div>
<p>Planning, designing and installing a new kitchen in your home doesn’t come cheap so it’s important to get the layout right by thinking ahead. No amount of whizzy appliances and expensive cabinetry can rescue a poorly thought-out design that’s difficult to cook, eat and entertain in.</p>
<p><span id="more-17"></span></p>
<p>Most importantly, think about how the space is going to be used. There are tried and tested layouts that have their pros and cons and the shape and size of your kitchen will determine which is best for you. Where your plumbing is will determine where your sink, washing machine and dishwasher will be, for example.</p>
<p>You’ve probably heard kitchen specialists refer to the ‘golden triangle’. They’re talking about the three components in a kitchen that tend to get the most use: the cooking area, the sink and the fridge. It’s generally recommended that they are near to each other to maximise efficiency.</p>
<p>The classic layouts are – single galley and double galley, which tend to have continuous runs of cabinets, L-shaped, which make use of a corner (like in the image below) and are ideal for smaller kitchens and U-shaped, which have units and appliances on three sides, keeping everything in easy reach. Everything else tends to be a variation on one of these themes.</p>
<p>If you’re a cook who likes to see your guests while you’re cooking, a central island with a food preparation area and integrated hob and oven is ideal, and is also a great way to break up a large open-plan space (see image below). It makes your kitchen into a social area which is how so many of us are using them these days. They’re no longer just for eating in – they really are the heart of the home. Wi-fi means we can work anywhere and increasingly, that place is our kitchens. This means they need to work harder, so make sure you plan in plenty of plug sockets so laptops and phone chargers can be plugged in. Install adequate lighting, too – there’s nothing worse than gloomy lighting to make a space unwelcoming.</p>
<div class="pivotx-wrapper"><img class="pivotx-image" title="" src="https://www.nakedkitchens.com/blog/images/2015-12/naked-kitched---gayton-5.jpg" alt="" /></div>
<p>Make sure you have plenty of counter space for food preparation and plating up. Where possible, have your microwave built in to free up worktop space. The aforementioned kitchen island can offer extra counter space if you have room for one. Don’t be tempted to put an island in if your kitchen is small, though. You’ll end up causing more problems than you solve. Ensure there’s plenty of room to move around it. The same goes for your dining table. Remember to factor in the chairs. What initially appears to be a large space can soon shrink when you start adding in furniture.</p>
<p>Don’t skimp on storage. Make sure you have plenty of room for all your pots, pans, tableware and small appliances. If you like an uncluttered look, this becomes even more important otherwise you’ll end up with food mixers, pasta machines and juicers out on display.</p>
<p>If you’re not sure what will work best for you then talk to an expert. Visit our showroom or go online to get inspiration, or talk your ideas through with one of our designers.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>If you’re looking for a versatile, functional and timeless kitchen style, look no further than a Shaker kitchen! Find out more about this style here.</p>
<div class="pivotx-wrapper"><img class="pivotx-image" title="shaker style kitchen" src="https://www.nakedkitchens.com/blog/images/2015-12/naked-kitched-two-017.jpg" alt="shaker style kitchen" /></div>
<p>Shaker furniture has always been renowned for its pared-down simplicity. You’ll find no unfussy detail and nothing that is there merely for show. Everything must have a function. It’s all about practicality without pretension. Function without fuss. And it’s this very simplicity, almost plainness, that gives it the timeless look that makes Shaker style a perennially popular choice for kitchen cabinetry in both traditional and contemporary spaces.</p>
<p><span id="more-18"></span></p>
<p>The Shakers were self-sufficient religious communities and Shaker craftsmen, revered for the quality of their workmanship, always worked with the best materials that were available locally to build durable furniture that would stand the test of time. Quality was paramount and traditional joinery techniques were used to ensure the furniture endured. And it had to look as good at the back as it did at the front. ‘God can see everywhere’, the devout Shakers believed. Adornment such as veneering and other decorative embellishments were frowned upon as being dishonest.</p>
<p>It’s also its simplicity and orderly appearance that gives 21st century Shaker kitchen furniture its versatility and makes it ideal for creating bespoke kitchens to fit any space. A basic Shaker kitchen design can be dressed up to suit your vision with handles, worktops and different paint finishes; end cabinets or worktop ends can be curved to soften the geometric squareness that often characterises Shaker furniture; appliances can be integrated to maintain a streamlined look. Islands can be installed to echo the original freestanding units that Shaker kitchens commonly had. The possibilities are many.</p>
<div class="pivotx-wrapper"><img class="pivotx-image" title="traditional shaker kitchen" src="https://www.nakedkitchens.com/blog/images/2015-12/stiffkey-blue.jpg" alt="traditional shaker kitchen" /></div>
<p>The timeless ‘in-frame’ design of a Shaker cabinet blends precise engineering with expert craftsmanship to create kitchens that are suitable for both traditional and contemporary kitchens and spaces that combine both, as you can see in the image below. The simply but elegantly designed cabinets have been fitted with classic polished metal cup handles and blend beautifully with the dramatic granite worktops and the ultra-modern expanse of stainless steel to create a space that is both harmonious and practical.</p>
<p>The Shaker style lends itself to being painted in muted shades of grey, green, cream or deep blue, indeed, original Shaker furniture was often painted in a limited palette of colours: shades of blue, green, yellow or red. It’s a great way to offset its simplicity if you want to make a statement in your kitchen. In the kitchen below the blue of the cabinetry contrasts superbly with the crisp white Aga and the natural warmth and beauty of the chunky wooden worktops and cabinet backs.</p>
<p>You can’t go wrong with Shaker style. Ideal for kitchens large or small, classic or modern, the Shaker-style kitchen is endlessly versatile. Clean, simple lines, quality materials and excellent craftsmanship are the original foundations the Shakers built upon and we keep those same principles in mind when designing all of our kitchens.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Timber is a beautiful and warm material that contributes to wonderful interiors and remains on trend. Do you want an interior space that looks tired after a few years? Probably not. Here are a few examples of timber being used in an interior setting that add that timeless edge that other materials can lack.</p>
<div class="pivotx-wrapper"><img class="pivotx-image" title="Old Mill Kitchen" src="https://www.nakedkitchens.com/blog/images/2015-09/mill-kitchen.jpg" alt="Old Mill Kitchen" /></div>
<div class="pivotx-wrapper"></div>
<p><span id="more-19"></span></p>
<p>Warm grey cabinets are complimented by tones of wood throughout the kitchen dining area. The continuation of this material ties in the theme beautifully with wooden doors, island corner posts and a unique table leg.</p>
<div class="pivotx-wrapper"><img class="pivotx-image" title="White Oak Table &amp; Chairs" src="https://www.nakedkitchens.com/blog/images/2015-09/white-oak.jpg" alt="White Oak Table &amp; Chairs" /></div>
<p>American White Oak flooring, seating area, work surface and accessories look stunning and add warmth to the lightly coloured kitchen cabinets.</p>
<div class="pivotx-wrapper"><img class="pivotx-image" title="contemporary kitchens" src="https://www.nakedkitchens.com/blog/images/2015-09/contemporary.jpg" alt="contemporary kitchens" /></div>
<p>Stunning American White Oak work surfaces combined with beautiful oak cabinetry stand out vibrantly against a subtler backdrop. Oak drawer boxes and peg boards fuse this material behind the front façade.</p>
