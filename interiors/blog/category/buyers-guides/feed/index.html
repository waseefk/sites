				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>With our round up of 2017 post, we let you know all of the trends we were loving for the kitchen in 2017, and so we thought it was only right that we share our prediction of kitchen trends for 2018. With January now over, there have been some clear paths set, making it much easier to see which trends are emerging, and which ones look set to stay!</p>
<p><strong>METALS<br />
</strong>The use of metal in the kitchen is something that we saw more and more of towards the end of 2017, but 2018 is set to see metals used in much more of a statement way. With beautiful darker colours being used in kitchens, brighter metals are being used alongside to provide beautiful accents throughout the room. Traditional metals such as gold and silver will always have a place in kitchen designs, but bolder metals like brass and copper are really pushing their way through. Copper in particular- a metal generally only seen in the kitchen in the form of saucepans- is being used to create incredible accessories, such as faucets and sinks, with a beautiful patina forming over time.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone wp-image-850 size-large" src="https://www.nakedkitchens.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/sites/8/2018/01/mood-board-4-1024x683.jpg" alt="" width="640" height="427" srcset="https://www.nakedkitchens.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/sites/8/2018/01/mood-board-4-1024x683.jpg 1024w, https://www.nakedkitchens.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/sites/8/2018/01/mood-board-4-300x200.jpg 300w, https://www.nakedkitchens.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/sites/8/2018/01/mood-board-4-768x512.jpg 768w, https://www.nakedkitchens.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/sites/8/2018/01/mood-board-4.jpg 1500w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" /></p>
<p><span id="more-822"></span></p>
<p>The use of metal splashbacks is something we&#8217;re also looking forward to seeing more of within kitchen designs. Instantly catching the eye when you enter the room, the splashback is a beautiful feature. We particularly love when different finishes are applied to the metal, as beautiful individual markings are left on the feature.</p>
<p><strong>STATEMENT FLOORING<br />
</strong>Statement Flooring is a feature that we&#8217;re sure we&#8217;re going to see everywhere in 2018. Flooring is something that has always been on our radar when designing a kitchen, as obviously it can completely change the way a kitchen looks in an instant. We can&#8217;t deny that we have always loved seeing a beautiful wooden floor in a kitchen, in particular using<strong> </strong>limed oak floor to add a beautiful, subtle modern feel to a room.<br />
The Redhill Kitchen design we completed last year, contains an incredible statement floor that was actually a reclaimed gym floor, creating an eye catching feature from an element of a room that usually goes relatively unnoticed. We&#8217;re looking forward to seeing more unique flooring choices, including brighter and much darker floors.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone wp-image-695 size-large" src="https://www.nakedkitchens.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/sites/8/2017/11/Redhill-30-1024x683.jpg" alt="" width="640" height="427" srcset="https://www.nakedkitchens.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/sites/8/2017/11/Redhill-30-1024x683.jpg 1024w, https://www.nakedkitchens.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/sites/8/2017/11/Redhill-30-300x200.jpg 300w, https://www.nakedkitchens.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/sites/8/2017/11/Redhill-30-768x512.jpg 768w, https://www.nakedkitchens.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/sites/8/2017/11/Redhill-30.jpg 1500w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" /><em>Photography- NK Living</em></p>
<p><strong>DARKER COLOURED KITCHENS<br />
</strong>We will always love a white kitchen. They&#8217;re incredibly fresh, and make a room feel light and open, and will be a colour that many people will continue to choose for years to come. However, there is a new colour trend on the horizon, with many people&#8217;s attention turning to the much darker colours of the spectrum, such as Forest Green, Navy and Black.<br />
These types of colours are captivating and make a room incredibly rich and intense. These are not necessarily colours that will work in everyone&#8217;s space, but so far all of the kitchens that we&#8217;ve seen take this risk, it has definitely paid off for them! We&#8217;re also seeing a lot more walls and cabinetry painted in the same colour, which is a very intense and brave choice but gives a beautiful, rich warmth to the room.<br />
We also think that including bright metal accessories within the design of these dark rooms looks incredible, really bouncing and brightening the room against such a dark backdrop. Using a brighter worktop material such as a metal or timber will create a break between the walls and the cabinetry, ensuring the room doesn&#8217;t feel closed off and that there is still an element of brightness to the room.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone wp-image-208 size-large" src="https://www.nakedkitchens.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/sites/8/2016/10/ladbrooke-2-683x1024.jpg" alt="" width="640" height="960" srcset="https://www.nakedkitchens.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/sites/8/2016/10/ladbrooke-2-683x1024.jpg 683w, https://www.nakedkitchens.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/sites/8/2016/10/ladbrooke-2-200x300.jpg 200w, https://www.nakedkitchens.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/sites/8/2016/10/ladbrooke-2-768x1152.jpg 768w, https://www.nakedkitchens.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/sites/8/2016/10/ladbrooke-2.jpg 1000w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" /></p>
<p><strong>PERSONAL TOUCH<br />
</strong>Personalisation of your room will be a big feature in 2018. With many people opting for open shelving and open cabinets, this is a really easy way to add a personal touch to the room by displaying all of  your favourite items.<br />
One design we have seen that really allowed this was the beautiful oak dressing room we created for the Hertfordshire Manor House recently. A statement making room, that is completely open, with only the set back drawers for hidden storage, meaning all of the clients belongings were on show, really allowing their personality to shine through!</p>
<p><img class="alignnone wp-image-871 size-large" src="https://www.nakedkitchens.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/sites/8/2018/01/Claytons-10-1024x683.jpg" alt="" width="640" height="427" srcset="https://www.nakedkitchens.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/sites/8/2018/01/Claytons-10-1024x683.jpg 1024w, https://www.nakedkitchens.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/sites/8/2018/01/Claytons-10-300x200.jpg 300w, https://www.nakedkitchens.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/sites/8/2018/01/Claytons-10-768x512.jpg 768w, https://www.nakedkitchens.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/sites/8/2018/01/Claytons-10.jpg 1500w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" /></p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>We&#8217;ve been busy here at Naked Kitchens getting to grips with the new trends and looks that are set to be popular in 2018. With the announcement of Dulux&#8217;s colour of 2018 Heartwood and Pantone releasing Ultra Violet as their chosen colour, it&#8217;s clear that purple will be involved within interiors this year. One of our creative kitchen designers created this mood board based around their favourite looks and much of the inspiration comes from what we&#8217;ve been designing with clients!</p>
<p><img class="alignnone wp-image-849 size-large" src="https://www.nakedkitchens.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/sites/8/2018/01/mood-board-3-1024x683.jpg" alt="" width="640" height="427" srcset="https://www.nakedkitchens.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/sites/8/2018/01/mood-board-3-1024x683.jpg 1024w, https://www.nakedkitchens.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/sites/8/2018/01/mood-board-3-300x200.jpg 300w, https://www.nakedkitchens.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/sites/8/2018/01/mood-board-3-768x512.jpg 768w, https://www.nakedkitchens.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/sites/8/2018/01/mood-board-3.jpg 1500w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" /></p>
<p><span id="more-847"></span></p>
<p>The use of heart wood as a colour is something that we&#8217;re absolutely loving seeing in kitchens at the moment. The beautiful pink tones in this colour work incredibly well with the oak and the marble within this combination and create a timeless colour palette.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone wp-image-848 size-large" src="https://www.nakedkitchens.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/sites/8/2018/01/mood-board-1-683x1024.jpg" alt="" width="640" height="960" srcset="https://www.nakedkitchens.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/sites/8/2018/01/mood-board-1-683x1024.jpg 683w, https://www.nakedkitchens.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/sites/8/2018/01/mood-board-1-200x300.jpg 200w, https://www.nakedkitchens.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/sites/8/2018/01/mood-board-1-768x1152.jpg 768w, https://www.nakedkitchens.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/sites/8/2018/01/mood-board-1.jpg 1000w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" /></p>
<p>By using darker accent colours it means that there is an additional depth to this design that gives a beautiful richness despite the natural feel of the collection. By using oak as the main timber choice it means that everything feels incredibly natural, and the whitewash finish ensures that the contemporary vibe isn&#8217;t lost and that everything is in-keeping with the cooler tones of the colours.</p>
<p>Despite the investment in colour in kitchens recently, we will always love grey in a kitchen, and we think it looks especially timeless and beautiful in a traditional shaker kitchen design. Recently we&#8217;ve seen examples of kitchens finished in a matte grey, and we think this is a beautiful way to have an updated version of a timeless neutral in your kitchen, and this works beautifully in a more contemporary, slab door style.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone wp-image-850 size-large" src="https://www.nakedkitchens.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/sites/8/2018/01/mood-board-4-1024x683.jpg" alt="" width="640" height="427" srcset="https://www.nakedkitchens.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/sites/8/2018/01/mood-board-4-1024x683.jpg 1024w, https://www.nakedkitchens.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/sites/8/2018/01/mood-board-4-300x200.jpg 300w, https://www.nakedkitchens.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/sites/8/2018/01/mood-board-4-768x512.jpg 768w, https://www.nakedkitchens.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/sites/8/2018/01/mood-board-4.jpg 1500w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" /></p>
<p>Using metals within your kitchen is still set to be very big 2018. With clients opting for brighter metals as a big feature in their kitchen such as copper and brass, there is no slowing down of the metallic trend this year. We are loving the use of copper within this design, as we think it really pops next to the white washed oak and the colours used, due to the bright, rose undertones.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone wp-image-851 size-large" src="https://www.nakedkitchens.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/sites/8/2018/01/mood-board-6-1024x683.jpg" alt="" width="640" height="427" srcset="https://www.nakedkitchens.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/sites/8/2018/01/mood-board-6-1024x683.jpg 1024w, https://www.nakedkitchens.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/sites/8/2018/01/mood-board-6-300x200.jpg 300w, https://www.nakedkitchens.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/sites/8/2018/01/mood-board-6-768x512.jpg 768w, https://www.nakedkitchens.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/sites/8/2018/01/mood-board-6.jpg 1500w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" /></p>
<p>Within this design the use of white accessories and marble helps to keep it clean a bright. Oak is generally a timber that can look quite warm and traditional, so by keeping everything else light and bright it ensures that this design will never look dated. White within a kitchen is never going to be out of fashion, so it is always a brilliant colour to bring into a design to keep it looking fresh.</p>
<p>We hope you enjoyed seeing what we&#8217;re loving in kitchens at the moment, and that it gave you some inspiration for your future kitchen!

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>What is a Bespoke Kitchen?<br />
</strong>Re-designing a space can be difficult enough without having the added worry of cost, function, and depreciation. But unlike picking the wrong colour sofa cushions or curtains that clash with the wallpaper, a kitchen is a little harder to change once you&#8217;ve committed!<br />
Purchasing a new kitchen for your home is a very big decision, and nobody wants to be left with a kitchen they don&#8217;t truly love every part of. At Naked Kitchens this won&#8217;t happen, as we will always go the extra step to ensure you love every single detail of your design before the material has even been cut!<br />
A bespoke kitchen is one that is entirely unique to each and every client. There is no standard sizing, and whilst we have kitchen designs that can be followed for inspiration, we can create completely unique designs for every customer. We use the finest natural resources to produce beautiful, sturdy and timeless kitchen cabinetry. With the choice of any fascia colour or exposed natural timber to complement all tastes, we guarantee pure kitchen love.</p>
<p style="text-align: left"><img class="alignnone wp-image-652 size-large" src="https://www.nakedkitchens.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/sites/8/2017/10/raynham-5-683x1024.jpg" alt="" width="640" height="960" srcset="https://www.nakedkitchens.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/sites/8/2017/10/raynham-5-683x1024.jpg 683w, https://www.nakedkitchens.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/sites/8/2017/10/raynham-5-200x300.jpg 200w, https://www.nakedkitchens.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/sites/8/2017/10/raynham-5-768x1152.jpg 768w, https://www.nakedkitchens.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/sites/8/2017/10/raynham-5.jpg 1000w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" /></p>
<p><span id="more-656"></span></p>
<p><strong>But what does it really mean to have a bespoke kitchen?</strong></p>
<p>Contrary to some opinions, a truly bespoke kitchen is 100% tailor-made and designed for the client. Whilst some kitchen companies claim to be fully bespoke, the reality is that they simply offer different pre-determined options and limit the customers to standard sizes. Unlike these manufacturers, Naked Kitchens offer a fully bespoke service. Whilst other kitchen manufacturers stockpile kitchen cabinets in standard sizes, we will not even cut our materials until your tailor-made kitchen design is exactly as you want it. This not only ensures a reduction in waste material but it also means you get your dream kitchen that is the perfect size!</p>
<p><img class="alignnone wp-image-208 size-large" src="https://www.nakedkitchens.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/sites/8/2016/10/ladbrooke-2-683x1024.jpg" alt="" width="640" height="960" srcset="https://www.nakedkitchens.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/sites/8/2016/10/ladbrooke-2-683x1024.jpg 683w, https://www.nakedkitchens.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/sites/8/2016/10/ladbrooke-2-200x300.jpg 200w, https://www.nakedkitchens.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/sites/8/2016/10/ladbrooke-2-768x1152.jpg 768w, https://www.nakedkitchens.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/sites/8/2016/10/ladbrooke-2.jpg 1000w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" /></p>
<p><strong>So how do we create a truly bespoke kitchen?</strong></p>
<p>We offer a design service for our clients, as we like to get to know our customers tastes and preferences, as well as asking for a room plan for the space so that we know the dimensions we are working with. From creating custom built beautiful larders to developing clever storage solutions to hide bulky appliances, everything we create is truly bespoke. With the technology that we have invested in we are able to take the design we have created on the screen, straight to our cutting machines. This means that we can get the bespoke kitchen to you much quicker, whilst creating minimal waste too.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone wp-image-379 size-large" src="https://www.nakedkitchens.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/sites/8/2017/08/Raynham-Larder-683x1024.jpg" alt="" width="640" height="960" srcset="https://www.nakedkitchens.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/sites/8/2017/08/Raynham-Larder-683x1024.jpg 683w, https://www.nakedkitchens.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/sites/8/2017/08/Raynham-Larder-200x300.jpg 200w, https://www.nakedkitchens.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/sites/8/2017/08/Raynham-Larder-768x1152.jpg 768w, https://www.nakedkitchens.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/sites/8/2017/08/Raynham-Larder.jpg 1000w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" /></p>
<p>To us, working with just standard cabinet size or configurations will completely limit all creativity when designing a kitchen. Creating a standard kitchen is just not in our nature. Whilst some elements of a kitchen will always remain the same, such as the need for a sink and cooker, we will never limit you on having typical 600 x 800 cabinets throughout, nor will we restrict you on the formation within, with many bespoke internal features available.<br />

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>We&#8217;re kicking off our latest series on the blog, which focuses on the use of colour, and with what is generally considered the biggest announcement in the colour world. This series will focus mainly on colour within the kitchen, but we will also look broadly at the latest trends in colour!</p>
<p><img src="https://www.designboom.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/pantone-color-of-the-year-2018-ultra-violet-designboom-1800.jpg" alt="Image result for pantone color of the year 2018" /></p>
<p><span id="more-770"></span></p>
<p>So December has come around incredibly quickly, and once again Pantone&#8217;s colour of the year has been announced, and it seems that this year the announcement is more controversial than ever! The colour of 2018- Ultra Violet- is described as: &#8216;Complex and contemplative, Ultra Violet suggests the mysteries of the cosmos, the intrigue of what lies ahead, and the discoveries beyond where we are now.&#8217;</p>
<p>Definitely a controversial choice from Pantone, and whilst it lies in the same &#8216;bright, jewel-like tones&#8217; as the 2017 colour of the year &#8216;Greenery&#8217;, this colour doesn&#8217;t make as much sense to a lot of interior specialists and bloggers. With Greenery being linked to nature, it was really quite easy to bring this into the household, whereas many are struggling to see where Pantone will fit into their homes.</p>
<p>A very bold colour that will definitely only work when used in a certain way, but it&#8217;s difficult to see this ever being used as the main colour of a room. With many describing this colour as incredibly similar to the purple used on Cadbury&#8217;s packaging, it&#8217;s possible that we may not see as much of this colour in 2018 interiors as we are used to with all of Pantone&#8217;s other colour choices.</p>
<p>This colour is bright and bold, and is also very different to the &#8216;rich, earthy&#8217; colours that we have been loving recently. But whilst we and many others remain quite sceptical for the moment, we&#8217;re certainly not ruling out the potential that Ultra Violet has, and we&#8217;re sure that it will actually look incredibly beautiful when used in the right way!<img class="alignnone wp-image-629 size-large" src="https://www.nakedkitchens.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/sites/8/2017/10/kia-designs-8-1024x666.jpg" alt="" width="640" height="416" srcset="https://www.nakedkitchens.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/sites/8/2017/10/kia-designs-8-1024x666.jpg 1024w, https://www.nakedkitchens.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/sites/8/2017/10/kia-designs-8-300x195.jpg 300w, https://www.nakedkitchens.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/sites/8/2017/10/kia-designs-8-768x500.jpg 768w, https://www.nakedkitchens.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/sites/8/2017/10/kia-designs-8.jpg 1500w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" /></p>
<p>At Naked Kitchens we&#8217;re particularly fond of using a bold colour in the kitchen. Our Highbury Kitchen uses the beautiful Dulux Storyteller to create a statement island in this colourful yet compact design. We particularly love the rich, jewel tones of the purple used and by using the colour on one element of the kitchen, this is a perfect way for people to inject Ultra Violet into their kitchens.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>One design element that we often recommend to our clients here at Naked Kitchens is to have a splashback in the kitchen. Splashbacks can be added as a feature in a beautiful kitchen, or as protection for walls from splashing pots and pans or taps, as they are often easily wipe able and easy to maintain. Some of our favourite kitchen designs we have ever created have splashbacks in them, and each looks completely unique in its own way, with the splashback adding an incredible eye catching feature.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone wp-image-639 size-large" src="https://www.nakedkitchens.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/sites/8/2017/10/brixton-6-683x1024.jpg" alt="" width="640" height="960" srcset="https://www.nakedkitchens.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/sites/8/2017/10/brixton-6-683x1024.jpg 683w, https://www.nakedkitchens.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/sites/8/2017/10/brixton-6-200x300.jpg 200w, https://www.nakedkitchens.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/sites/8/2017/10/brixton-6-768x1152.jpg 768w, https://www.nakedkitchens.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/sites/8/2017/10/brixton-6.jpg 1000w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" /></p>
<p><span id="more-634"></span></p>
<p>One of our most memorable designs, and also one of our most liked on social media is the Ladbroke Kitchen and its bronze splashback. An item that we created by hand, one evening in the directors kitchen no less, the bronze splashback has certainly gained some attention since we released the photos of this kitchen design. Antiqued by hand, every splashback we make is completely unique and made to order. So far, we have only experimented with this metal, but we are looking to incorporate other metals into our designs in the future. The bronze splashback combines beautifully with the other bronze elements within this design, and reflects light around the room, making it seem much larger than it is.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone wp-image-208 size-large" src="https://www.nakedkitchens.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/sites/8/2016/10/ladbrooke-2-683x1024.jpg" alt="" width="640" height="960" srcset="https://www.nakedkitchens.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/sites/8/2016/10/ladbrooke-2-683x1024.jpg 683w, https://www.nakedkitchens.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/sites/8/2016/10/ladbrooke-2-200x300.jpg 200w, https://www.nakedkitchens.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/sites/8/2016/10/ladbrooke-2-768x1152.jpg 768w, https://www.nakedkitchens.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/sites/8/2016/10/ladbrooke-2.jpg 1000w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" /></p>
<p>The antiqued foxed glass splashback in the Norfolk Vicarage Kitchen is especially fabulous. Behind the large stately AGA, this splashback makes a stunning statement. Despite being located in the area of the kitchen that has the least natural light and has the tendency to feel quite dark and closed off, the splashback actually reflects light from the beautiful garden, making the room feel open, spacious and incredibly light. A material that is potentially not the most practical, behind such a large source of heat, the glass will be easy to wipe and clean surface stains. The antiqued nature of the glass fits in perfectly with the traditional shaker kitchen in this listed building.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone wp-image-635 size-large" src="https://www.nakedkitchens.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/sites/8/2017/10/norfolk-vicarage-7-683x1024.jpg" alt="" width="640" height="960" srcset="https://www.nakedkitchens.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/sites/8/2017/10/norfolk-vicarage-7-683x1024.jpg 683w, https://www.nakedkitchens.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/sites/8/2017/10/norfolk-vicarage-7-200x300.jpg 200w, https://www.nakedkitchens.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/sites/8/2017/10/norfolk-vicarage-7-768x1152.jpg 768w, https://www.nakedkitchens.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/sites/8/2017/10/norfolk-vicarage-7.jpg 1000w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" /></p>
<p>This compact kitchen makes the most of its beautiful marble splashback. By having dark cabinetry and a very light coloured splashback and white wall cabinets, it keeps the eye-level of the kitchen bright and light, meaning it feels open and spacious, and never closed off, making the most of natural light. The Faraday Road kitchen is the perfect design for compact spaces. With minimal cabinetry, the marble splashback lends itself to making the statement for this kitchen design. Subtle and classic, this splashback isn&#8217;t ostentatious and doesn&#8217;t overpower such a small space. Matching the worktop, this splashback adds to the clean lines of the room and ensures everything remains sleek and sophisticated.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone wp-image-637 size-full" src="https://www.nakedkitchens.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/sites/8/2017/10/Faraday-Road-4.jpg" alt="" width="3600" height="2403" srcset="https://www.nakedkitchens.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/sites/8/2017/10/Faraday-Road-4.jpg 3600w, https://www.nakedkitchens.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/sites/8/2017/10/Faraday-Road-4-300x200.jpg 300w, https://www.nakedkitchens.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/sites/8/2017/10/Faraday-Road-4-768x513.jpg 768w, https://www.nakedkitchens.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/sites/8/2017/10/Faraday-Road-4-1024x684.jpg 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 3600px) 100vw, 3600px" /></p>
<p>The contrast in this kitchen is what makes this splashback work so well. Already a striking kitchen that makes a bold statement, the addition of the mottled grey tiles as a splashback makes this kitchen like no other. The Westbourne Gardens kitchen design is so unique, and whilst the splashback contrasts so dramatically, it actually works incredibly well. If you were to have a plainer, more simple splashback it would simply be lost against such bold cabinetry and handles, whereas you cannot deny this splashback instantly catches your eye. Easily cleaned and an incredibly durable material, these tiles add to the wondrous atmosphere of the room.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone wp-image-636 size-large" src="https://www.nakedkitchens.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/sites/8/2017/10/6-683x1024.jpg" alt="" width="640" height="960" srcset="https://www.nakedkitchens.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/sites/8/2017/10/6-683x1024.jpg 683w, https://www.nakedkitchens.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/sites/8/2017/10/6-200x300.jpg 200w, https://www.nakedkitchens.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/sites/8/2017/10/6-768x1152.jpg 768w, https://www.nakedkitchens.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/sites/8/2017/10/6.jpg 936w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" /><br />

<p>Finally, one of our more slightly more subtle designs but still incredibly stunning, is our Brancaster Marshes kitchen. The use of the antiqued glass as a splashback adds a beautiful element to this kitchen design, and ensures that light bounces around the room, making it feel bright and open. Having such a reflective splashback combined with floating shelves ensures that the room doesn&#8217;t feel like a sea of cabinetry. It keeps the eye-level of the room as light as possible, and also provides an interesting view for those sitting at the island. Glass is easy to clean but the antiqued nature of this particular piece means that you don&#8217;t have to worry about keeping it impossibly clean and smear-free.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>So here at Naked Kitchens we decided we wanted to start something new on our blog. As we create bespoke kitchens for our customers, we continually see different styling and colour combinations for a kitchen, and alongside keeping up with interior trends we constantly fall in love with new ideas. New unique colour combinations bring a whole new variety of colours into our palette that we hadn&#8217;t even considered putting in a kitchen before!</p>
<p>Constant updates of lighting options, beautiful handles and other kitchen necessities like taps and sinks give us so many more options to help you truly create the most beautiful kitchen. With the addition of incredible splashbacks, such as the foxed glass in our Norfolk Vicarage Kitchen, or the stunning antiqued brass splashback in our Ladbroke Kitchen really allows us to help you create the most unique kitchens, that are completely unlike anything else on the market.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone wp-image-208 size-large" src="https://www.nakedkitchens.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/sites/8/2016/10/ladbrooke-2-683x1024.jpg" alt="" width="640" height="960" srcset="https://www.nakedkitchens.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/sites/8/2016/10/ladbrooke-2-683x1024.jpg 683w, https://www.nakedkitchens.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/sites/8/2016/10/ladbrooke-2-200x300.jpg 200w, https://www.nakedkitchens.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/sites/8/2016/10/ladbrooke-2-768x1152.jpg 768w, https://www.nakedkitchens.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/sites/8/2016/10/ladbrooke-2.jpg 1000w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" /> <img class="alignnone wp-image-280 size-large" src="https://www.nakedkitchens.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/sites/8/2017/06/norfolk-vicarige-2-683x1024.jpg" alt="" width="640" height="960" srcset="https://www.nakedkitchens.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/sites/8/2017/06/norfolk-vicarige-2-683x1024.jpg 683w, https://www.nakedkitchens.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/sites/8/2017/06/norfolk-vicarige-2-200x300.jpg 200w, https://www.nakedkitchens.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/sites/8/2017/06/norfolk-vicarige-2-768x1152.jpg 768w, https://www.nakedkitchens.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/sites/8/2017/06/norfolk-vicarige-2.jpg 1000w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" /></p>
<p><span id="more-534"></span></p>
<p>We always try to recommend kitchen designs that fit with our customers lifestyle, as we want our kitchens to fit naturally within a home and truly be a part of your life. However we can only advise as to what we think may fit with you, and often it is the client that actually proposes some of the most beautiful ideas.</p>
<p>And we thought it was an excellent idea to share these ideas with you. Whether it be the latest beautiful faucet we&#8217;ve seen used in a clients kitchen, or an incredible colour combination such as a teal blue Ladbroke style kitchen with silver inlay, which is one of our more recent kitchens to go through the workshop, or one of our beautiful neutral shaker kitchens that are always coveted by many, due to their effortlessly timeless appeal.</p>

<p>Whether it&#8217;s just inspiration for updating your existing kitchen, or that kick start you need to begin the process of getting your dream kitchen; by seeing the different styles, colours, features and elements that you can have within your kitchen is likely to inspire you and give you fresh new ideas for what you would like in your kitchen, potentially even changing what you originally thought you wanted! This is the most important room in the house, and it has to feel completely right, as it is likely you will spend more time in this room than anywhere else in your home!</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>If there is one thing we have realised over the many years that we have been creating bespoke kitchens, it&#8217;s that nearly everyone wants a &#8216;modern shaker&#8217; kitchen. A contradiction in itself, as the shaker is a very traditional kitchen design that has been in history since the 18th century, and is not actually a new, modern kitchen style. However, we understand what customers mean when they say this, as they generally want a timeless kitchen design that isn&#8217;t old fashioned or super modern but will continue to look elegant in years to come. And that is a design that we love to create, time and time again.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone wp-image-455 size-large" src="https://www.nakedkitchens.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/sites/8/2017/08/cley-12-683x1024.jpg" alt="" width="640" height="960" srcset="https://www.nakedkitchens.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/sites/8/2017/08/cley-12-683x1024.jpg 683w, https://www.nakedkitchens.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/sites/8/2017/08/cley-12-200x300.jpg 200w, https://www.nakedkitchens.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/sites/8/2017/08/cley-12-768x1152.jpg 768w, https://www.nakedkitchens.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/sites/8/2017/08/cley-12.jpg 1000w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" /></p>
<p><span id="more-528"></span></p>
<p>One of our first and favourite kitchen designs- the Cley- shows the Shaker style at its best. With elegant panelling, and beautiful shaker style doors and drawers throughout the cabinetry, this kitchen is the perfect example of a timeless design. Minimalist in its accessories, classic end grain oak worktops and neutral colouring with a pop of bold blue, this kitchen encompasses everything that is vital to a classic kitchen. Despite being incredibly minimalist, the Shaker kitchens is actually one of the hardest to create, and the perfect Shaker kitchen has to be bespoke. It is the only way to achieve the impeccable proportions and symmetry, reflecting both the size and layout of the kitchen and the way the cabinets work together.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone wp-image-529 size-large" src="https://www.nakedkitchens.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/sites/8/2017/09/Norfolk-Oak-Kitchen-1-32-1024x683.jpg" alt="" width="640" height="427" srcset="https://www.nakedkitchens.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/sites/8/2017/09/Norfolk-Oak-Kitchen-1-32.jpg 1024w, https://www.nakedkitchens.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/sites/8/2017/09/Norfolk-Oak-Kitchen-1-32-300x200.jpg 300w, https://www.nakedkitchens.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/sites/8/2017/09/Norfolk-Oak-Kitchen-1-32-768x512.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" /></p>
<p>The Shaker style doesn&#8217;t have to always look like it belongs in a large country house however, as it can look truly beautiful in any space. The Quayside Shaker demonstrates this, as it makes the Shaker style look incredibly modern, with bright oak worktops, a coloured splash-back and an incredible compact cooking area on the island complete with a high tech induction hob. In a room that is incredibly open and has lots of natural light spilling through the patio doors, combining these classic shaker elements and the modern features creates a beautiful spacious shaker kitchen that is just perfect for everyday family life.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone wp-image-457 size-large" src="https://www.nakedkitchens.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/sites/8/2017/08/norfolk-vicarage-1-1024x683.jpg" alt="" width="640" height="427" srcset="https://www.nakedkitchens.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/sites/8/2017/08/norfolk-vicarage-1-1024x683.jpg 1024w, https://www.nakedkitchens.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/sites/8/2017/08/norfolk-vicarage-1-300x200.jpg 300w, https://www.nakedkitchens.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/sites/8/2017/08/norfolk-vicarage-1-768x512.jpg 768w, https://www.nakedkitchens.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/sites/8/2017/08/norfolk-vicarage-1.jpg 1500w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" /></p>
<p>And finally, another of our favourite shaker kitchen designs that technically sits in the &#8216;classic&#8217; category- The Norfolk Vicarage. A more recent project of ours, the Norfolk Vicarage kitchen was created for a large listed building in the Norfolk broads. With shaker doors and drawers this design is still beautifully minimalist, but has a few added extras that make it simply exquisite. With beading adding a beautiful extra detail to the cabinets, and Carrara Quartz marble worktops that are incredibly luxurious, this kitchen takes shaker classic to a whole new level. A kitchen that is ideal as the hub of family life and for entertaining guests.</p>

		<title>Why the work triangle is still relevant to kitchen design</title>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>You’ve probably heard kitchen designers talk about the kitchen work triangle. But what is it, and is it still relevant? The concept of the kitchen work triangle developed in the 1940s in order to help single cooks working in smaller kitchens maximise efficiency by positioning the most heavily used elements – the cooking, food preparation and storage areas – in close proximity to one another. If you were to draw an imaginary line from point to point, you would create a triangle from sink to cooker to refrigerator that is designed to make the space easy to use without wasting time moving from one end of the kitchen to the other. The idea grew out of Taylorism, which applied scientific thinking to engineering in order to improve economic efficiency and production, and its principles are still used in the design of kitchens large and small.</p>
<div class="pivotx-wrapper"><img class="pivotx-image" title="efficient kitchen design" src="https://www.nakedkitchens.com/blog/images/2016-02/old-mill-3.jpg" alt="efficient kitchen design" /></div>
<p>Read on to find out how the work triangle can make your kitchen easier and more enjoyable to cook in!</p>
<p><span id="more-12"></span></p>
<p><strong>What are the key principles of the work triangle?</strong></p>
<p>Most kitchen designers and architects still apply the same principles of clean, efficient design to residential kitchens todayand, size permitting, the following factors should govern the layout.</p>
<ul>
<li>A full-height cabinet, or kitchen island, should never come between any points of the triangle so the cook’s movement between work centres is not impeded.</li>
<li>The cabinets or any other obstacles should not intersect any leg of the triangle by more than 300mm.</li>
<li>The sides of any leg of the triangle should be between 1.2 and 2.7 metres, with the total of all three sides being between 4 and 8 metres.</li>
<li>Within the triangle, there should be no other traffic flow to ensure the chef can work safely and undisturbed.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>How the work triangle concept can benefit your kitchen</strong></p>
<p>These days our kitchens have become real hubs of family activity and are no longer just where we cook and eat. We’re entertaining friends, working at the kitchen table, the kids are doing their homework or craft projects – larger kitchens might even have a sofa and TV in, as well as additional preparation and cooking areas, so how these extra elements are laid out is important too. The same triangle concept can be applied here by grouping related activities together so the space works for everything that’s going on without one thing getting in the way of any other. You don’t want people traipsing through the main cooking, prep and storage triangle to get to the entertainment area, for example.</p>
<p>There are several main advantages of the work triangle:</p>
<ul>
<li>Cooking in a dedicated space is much easier as there’s enough room to perform specific tasks and everything is conveniently close to hand.</li>
<li>Minimising unnecessary traffic through the cooking space means the cook can get on with preparing meals without distractions.</li>
<li>As mentioned before, different activities can be zoned in order to avoid them interfering with each other: the preparation and cooking area, the dining/working area, and the entertainment area can all be self-contained spaces that contribute to the overall efficiency of your kitchen.</li>
</ul>
<div class="pivotx-wrapper"><img class="pivotx-image" title="kitchen design" src="https://www.nakedkitchens.com/blog/images/2016-02/alexandra-park-15.jpg" alt="kitchen design" /></div>
<p><strong>Incorporating the work triangle into your new kitchen</strong></p>
<p>If you’re about to change your kitchen layout or are starting from scratch, thinking about the work triangle and applying its principles can help you with planning the ideal layout for the various areas. Consider how your kitchen is going to be used: how much space you need for food preparation; where your dining table is going to go; will you have room for a breakfast bar; will there be space for working or for the kids to do schoolwork? Group areas and appliances together by activity in order to maximise efficiency and avoid people bumping into each other if the whole family is using the kitchen at once for different activities.</p>
<p>Ensuring your kitchen is planned with these things in mind will enable you to make the best use of the available space. If you need any help or advice on planning the perfect kitchen, we’ll be happy to share our knowledge and experience with you.</p>
<p>When thinking how to lay out your kitchen, consider the following ideas which can make it easier to cook in your kitchen:</p>
<ul>
<li>Make sure your fridge isn’t too far from the worktop or food preparation area so you can easily get to ingredients quickly and aren’t transporting them up and down the kitchen.</li>
<li>If you are planning on having a breakfast bar, make sure there’s plenty of preparation space elsewhere so that germs aren’t spread.</li>
<li>To make clean-up easier after meals, keep the sink, bin and dishwasher near to each other, again applying the triangle principle but on a smaller scale.</li>
<li>Avoid obstructions within the work triangle, ensuring islands, dining tables or full-height cabinets don’t get in the way of you moving around the triangle when cooking.</li>
<li>Make sure you’ve got plenty of worktop space for chopping and slicing ingredients near to the stove so it’s easier to add ingredients to your dishes without them dropping on the floor.</li>
<li>Think about where your pots, pans and utensils are going to be stored – ideally they’ll be near your stove so you can get at them quickly.</li>
</ul>

<p>Here at Naked Kitchens, we’re experts in marrying beautiful design with practical function. Because all our kitchens are bespoke, we are able to work with the space you have to create a kitchen that works perfectly for you.  To get more advice on how to to plan your kitchen to fit your needs, get in touch!</p>
<p>Below you can find some expert advice from our kitchen designers, on how to create an efficient kitchen space.</p>
<blockquote><p>“A truly bespoke kitchen means that we can manufacture each cabinet to the exact size required to fit within a defined space. This allows for a much more ergonomic flow to a kitchen. No filler cabinets required to fill that awkward gap. Difficult wall shapes, such as pillars, can also be overcome without compromising the resultant kitchen flow, by manufacturing the cabinet with a shallow depth where required.</p>
<p>A very practical end grain butchers block on the work surface above the kitchen bin cabinet works really well to define the food preparation area. After food preparation, waste can simply be scooped into the pull out bin below reducing spillage and mess.”</p>
<p>— <cite>Jayne Everett, Director, Kitchen Designer</cite></p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p>“The importance of the working triangle continues to strengthen as our kitchens become more and more multi-functional. Designing without this in mind can result in an ill-thought lay-out that creates a complicated living and working space rather than the hub of the home that the kitchen has become today. With this key rule in mind, and our made to order cabinetry, we are able to take this rule and expand it, ensuring that every detail is taken into consideration. Your integrated oven placement can be tailored to suit your height for example, or we can design those hard to reach spaces to suit appliances/objects that you want to keep out of the little one’s reach.”</p>
<p>— <cite>Jessie Hacking, Lead Kitchen Designer</cite></p></blockquote>

<p>Every home is different, so it’s important to plan a kitchen tailor made to fit your space.</p>
<p>Measure, measure and measure! The more accurate the measurement, the more precise your bespoke kitchen will be.</p>
<p><span id="more-13"></span></p>
<div class="pivotx-wrapper"><img class="pivotx-image" title="measuring your kitchen" src="https://www.nakedkitchens.com/blog/images/2016-01/measuring-cabinet.jpg" alt="measuring your kitchen" /></div>
<p>Inspiration &#8211; Have a look through magazines, social platforms and begin to get an idea of the sort of kitchens that you like. Look out for features in a kitchen &#8211; as everything is made to order you are not limited to a range. Like that door on one page and that drawer on another? No problem, we can manufacture it.</p>
<p>Familiarise yourself with the different kitchens that we have manufactured previously. What do you like and dislike?</p>
<p>Know your budget! We all have a budget of some description so let us help you keep within this by looking at your cabinetry configuration and style. One kitchen space can be worked into both low and high budgets; it&#8217;s just about being clever with where you put your money.</p>
<p>Know your appliances! Would you like integrated or freestanding? Do you already own your appliances? Appliances can dictate the lay-out of your kitchen and therefore serve as a great starting point. Want a dishwasher or washing machine for example? There’s a good chance it will need to be near your sink for water supply.</p>
<div class="pivotx-wrapper"><img class="pivotx-image" title="kitchen planning" src="https://www.nakedkitchens.com/blog/images/2016-01/essex-kitchen-012.jpg" alt="kitchen planning" /></div>
<p>Think of the bigger picture &#8211; Your kitchen cabinetry will be a focal point to the heart of your home. Begin to think about the colour scheme and how this will tie in with the rest of the room. What colour will be your walls and your furniture for example? and how will this look with the colour of your cabinetry?</p>
<p>Have fun! We are here to make this experience enjoyable for you. Having a kitchen made for you and you alone is a very exciting process. Let your imagination run with ideas and we will be here to lend advice along the way.</p>
