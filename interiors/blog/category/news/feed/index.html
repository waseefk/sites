				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>With our round up of 2017 post, we let you know all of the trends we were loving for the kitchen in 2017, and so we thought it was only right that we share our prediction of kitchen trends for 2018. With January now over, there have been some clear paths set, making it much easier to see which trends are emerging, and which ones look set to stay!</p>
<p><strong>METALS<br />
</strong>The use of metal in the kitchen is something that we saw more and more of towards the end of 2017, but 2018 is set to see metals used in much more of a statement way. With beautiful darker colours being used in kitchens, brighter metals are being used alongside to provide beautiful accents throughout the room. Traditional metals such as gold and silver will always have a place in kitchen designs, but bolder metals like brass and copper are really pushing their way through. Copper in particular- a metal generally only seen in the kitchen in the form of saucepans- is being used to create incredible accessories, such as faucets and sinks, with a beautiful patina forming over time.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone wp-image-850 size-large" src="https://www.nakedkitchens.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/sites/8/2018/01/mood-board-4-1024x683.jpg" alt="" width="640" height="427" srcset="https://www.nakedkitchens.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/sites/8/2018/01/mood-board-4-1024x683.jpg 1024w, https://www.nakedkitchens.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/sites/8/2018/01/mood-board-4-300x200.jpg 300w, https://www.nakedkitchens.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/sites/8/2018/01/mood-board-4-768x512.jpg 768w, https://www.nakedkitchens.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/sites/8/2018/01/mood-board-4.jpg 1500w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" /></p>
<p><span id="more-822"></span></p>
<p>The use of metal splashbacks is something we&#8217;re also looking forward to seeing more of within kitchen designs. Instantly catching the eye when you enter the room, the splashback is a beautiful feature. We particularly love when different finishes are applied to the metal, as beautiful individual markings are left on the feature.</p>
<p><strong>STATEMENT FLOORING<br />
</strong>Statement Flooring is a feature that we&#8217;re sure we&#8217;re going to see everywhere in 2018. Flooring is something that has always been on our radar when designing a kitchen, as obviously it can completely change the way a kitchen looks in an instant. We can&#8217;t deny that we have always loved seeing a beautiful wooden floor in a kitchen, in particular using<strong> </strong>limed oak floor to add a beautiful, subtle modern feel to a room.<br />
The Redhill Kitchen design we completed last year, contains an incredible statement floor that was actually a reclaimed gym floor, creating an eye catching feature from an element of a room that usually goes relatively unnoticed. We&#8217;re looking forward to seeing more unique flooring choices, including brighter and much darker floors.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone wp-image-695 size-large" src="https://www.nakedkitchens.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/sites/8/2017/11/Redhill-30-1024x683.jpg" alt="" width="640" height="427" srcset="https://www.nakedkitchens.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/sites/8/2017/11/Redhill-30-1024x683.jpg 1024w, https://www.nakedkitchens.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/sites/8/2017/11/Redhill-30-300x200.jpg 300w, https://www.nakedkitchens.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/sites/8/2017/11/Redhill-30-768x512.jpg 768w, https://www.nakedkitchens.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/sites/8/2017/11/Redhill-30.jpg 1500w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" /><em>Photography- NK Living</em></p>
<p><strong>DARKER COLOURED KITCHENS<br />
</strong>We will always love a white kitchen. They&#8217;re incredibly fresh, and make a room feel light and open, and will be a colour that many people will continue to choose for years to come. However, there is a new colour trend on the horizon, with many people&#8217;s attention turning to the much darker colours of the spectrum, such as Forest Green, Navy and Black.<br />
These types of colours are captivating and make a room incredibly rich and intense. These are not necessarily colours that will work in everyone&#8217;s space, but so far all of the kitchens that we&#8217;ve seen take this risk, it has definitely paid off for them! We&#8217;re also seeing a lot more walls and cabinetry painted in the same colour, which is a very intense and brave choice but gives a beautiful, rich warmth to the room.<br />
We also think that including bright metal accessories within the design of these dark rooms looks incredible, really bouncing and brightening the room against such a dark backdrop. Using a brighter worktop material such as a metal or timber will create a break between the walls and the cabinetry, ensuring the room doesn&#8217;t feel closed off and that there is still an element of brightness to the room.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone wp-image-208 size-large" src="https://www.nakedkitchens.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/sites/8/2016/10/ladbrooke-2-683x1024.jpg" alt="" width="640" height="960" srcset="https://www.nakedkitchens.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/sites/8/2016/10/ladbrooke-2-683x1024.jpg 683w, https://www.nakedkitchens.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/sites/8/2016/10/ladbrooke-2-200x300.jpg 200w, https://www.nakedkitchens.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/sites/8/2016/10/ladbrooke-2-768x1152.jpg 768w, https://www.nakedkitchens.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/sites/8/2016/10/ladbrooke-2.jpg 1000w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" /></p>
<p><strong>PERSONAL TOUCH<br />
</strong>Personalisation of your room will be a big feature in 2018. With many people opting for open shelving and open cabinets, this is a really easy way to add a personal touch to the room by displaying all of  your favourite items.<br />
One design we have seen that really allowed this was the beautiful oak dressing room we created for the Hertfordshire Manor House recently. A statement making room, that is completely open, with only the set back drawers for hidden storage, meaning all of the clients belongings were on show, really allowing their personality to shine through!</p>
<p><img class="alignnone wp-image-871 size-large" src="https://www.nakedkitchens.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/sites/8/2018/01/Claytons-10-1024x683.jpg" alt="" width="640" height="427" srcset="https://www.nakedkitchens.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/sites/8/2018/01/Claytons-10-1024x683.jpg 1024w, https://www.nakedkitchens.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/sites/8/2018/01/Claytons-10-300x200.jpg 300w, https://www.nakedkitchens.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/sites/8/2018/01/Claytons-10-768x512.jpg 768w, https://www.nakedkitchens.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/sites/8/2018/01/Claytons-10.jpg 1500w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" /></p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>We always love it when our beautiful kitchens get noticed by people. Whilst we try to share as many images as possible of our kitchens, we are sure that there will still be people who have not seen our kitchens<b>!</b> So when local interiors company Birdie Fortescue contacted us to see if they could use our show room as the backdrop for photos of their spring/summer collection, we didn&#8217;t hesitate to say yes, as this is a brilliant way to show off our incredible kitchens through a new channel!</p>
<p><img src="https://pbs.twimg.com/media/DQx9P_1VoAAfww-.jpg:large" /></p>
<p><span id="more-777"></span></p>
<p>Birdie Fortescue is an interiors business based in Burnham Market, with a shop and website, selling an eclectic mix of both painted and polished antique furniture, all of which are united by the same understated elegance and charm, and contemporary homeware, picked by Birdie herself, from far-flung corners of the globe. We were absolutely delighted to have a company that we often use for styling inspiration want to use our kitchens!</p>
<p><img src="https://pbs.twimg.com/media/DTBaQBbXUAIifs3.jpg:large" /></p>
<p>Birdie got in contact with us to see if they would be able to use our showroom kitchens as a background for their spring/summer collection of tableware. As both of our companies are incredibly contemporary, and strive to break the norms of interiors and design, we knew that it would be a brilliant fit. With Birdie styling the shoot herself, and our stunning kitchens shining with beauty in the background, there was no doubt that this photoshoot was going to result in some incredibly beautiful images.</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/2601/7430/files/naked-kitchens-6.jpg" /></p>
<p>With the launch of their new website, Birdie Fortescue will be releasing these images to coincide with their latest collection landing. We&#8217;ve seen a few sneak peaks of the images before the new website was launched, as we couldn&#8217;t wait for everyone to see them as they look incredible! The items in the collection would look great in any kitchen, but there is no doubt that they particularly shine within our beautiful kitchen designs.</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/2601/7430/files/naked-kitchens-5.jpg" /></p>
<p>Check out our <a href="http://instagram.com/nakedkitchens">Instagram </a>and <a href="http://twitter.com/nakedkitchens">Twitter </a>for more pictures of our kitchens, and Birdie&#8217;s blog <a href="https://birdiefortescue.co.uk/blogs/blog/on-location-with-naked-kitchens-norfolk">post</a> which has more beautiful images, and why not check out their incredible product range on their brand new website!</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>We&#8217;re kicking off our latest series on the blog, which focuses on the use of colour, and with what is generally considered the biggest announcement in the colour world. This series will focus mainly on colour within the kitchen, but we will also look broadly at the latest trends in colour!</p>
<p><img src="https://www.designboom.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/pantone-color-of-the-year-2018-ultra-violet-designboom-1800.jpg" alt="Image result for pantone color of the year 2018" /></p>
<p><span id="more-770"></span></p>
<p>So December has come around incredibly quickly, and once again Pantone&#8217;s colour of the year has been announced, and it seems that this year the announcement is more controversial than ever! The colour of 2018- Ultra Violet- is described as: &#8216;Complex and contemplative, Ultra Violet suggests the mysteries of the cosmos, the intrigue of what lies ahead, and the discoveries beyond where we are now.&#8217;</p>
<p>Definitely a controversial choice from Pantone, and whilst it lies in the same &#8216;bright, jewel-like tones&#8217; as the 2017 colour of the year &#8216;Greenery&#8217;, this colour doesn&#8217;t make as much sense to a lot of interior specialists and bloggers. With Greenery being linked to nature, it was really quite easy to bring this into the household, whereas many are struggling to see where Pantone will fit into their homes.</p>
<p>A very bold colour that will definitely only work when used in a certain way, but it&#8217;s difficult to see this ever being used as the main colour of a room. With many describing this colour as incredibly similar to the purple used on Cadbury&#8217;s packaging, it&#8217;s possible that we may not see as much of this colour in 2018 interiors as we are used to with all of Pantone&#8217;s other colour choices.</p>
<p>This colour is bright and bold, and is also very different to the &#8216;rich, earthy&#8217; colours that we have been loving recently. But whilst we and many others remain quite sceptical for the moment, we&#8217;re certainly not ruling out the potential that Ultra Violet has, and we&#8217;re sure that it will actually look incredibly beautiful when used in the right way!<img class="alignnone wp-image-629 size-large" src="https://www.nakedkitchens.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/sites/8/2017/10/kia-designs-8-1024x666.jpg" alt="" width="640" height="416" srcset="https://www.nakedkitchens.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/sites/8/2017/10/kia-designs-8-1024x666.jpg 1024w, https://www.nakedkitchens.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/sites/8/2017/10/kia-designs-8-300x195.jpg 300w, https://www.nakedkitchens.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/sites/8/2017/10/kia-designs-8-768x500.jpg 768w, https://www.nakedkitchens.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/sites/8/2017/10/kia-designs-8.jpg 1500w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" /></p>
<p>At Naked Kitchens we&#8217;re particularly fond of using a bold colour in the kitchen. Our Highbury Kitchen uses the beautiful Dulux Storyteller to create a statement island in this colourful yet compact design. We particularly love the rich, jewel tones of the purple used and by using the colour on one element of the kitchen, this is a perfect way for people to inject Ultra Violet into their kitchens.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>2017 has certainly been the year for Naked Kitchens gaining awareness within the manufacturing industry, as not only have we been invited to contribute to this years Parliamentary Review for the Manufacturing Industry, but Naked Kitchens were also invited to speak about building and growing a successful business at the HSBC Strategies For Growth event!</p>
<p><img class="alignnone wp-image-733 size-full" src="https://www.nakedkitchens.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/sites/8/2017/11/parliamentary-review-badge.png" alt="" width="516" height="199" srcset="https://www.nakedkitchens.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/sites/8/2017/11/parliamentary-review-badge.png 516w, https://www.nakedkitchens.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/sites/8/2017/11/parliamentary-review-badge-300x116.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 516px) 100vw, 516px" /></p>
<p><span id="more-668"></span></p>
<p>As many of you may already know, Norfolk Oak is the parent company of Naked Kitchens, and is the inspiration behind our bespoke kitchen business. Norfolk Oak is a company that creates beautiful bespoke wooden worktops and custom furniture pieces, and are experts in woods and timber, knowing exactly how to get the best out of this beautiful material. Using timber from ethical, sustainable sources, there is no doubt that Norfolk Oak and Naked Kitchen&#8217;s products are miles in front of competitors in this industry.</p>
<p>Over time, Norfolk Oak have been recognised for the beautiful products they were creating, and it wasn&#8217;t long after building up this business that the requests came flooding in to create kitchens for people. After spending a small period of time developing the best way to create these kitchens for our clients, we developed Naked Kitchens, whom create bespoke kitchens at an incredibly fair and transparent price. Working on a manufacturing and supply basis only, both Norfolk Oak and Naked Kitchens provide an easy way to buy bespoke timber kitchens and products at lower prices considering the quality of the material used. One reason why Norfolk Oak and Naked Kitchens are able to do this, is because we don&#8217;t have lots of ostentatious showrooms on the high street, and we work one location in Norfolk where all elements of our business work together under one roof, meaning we don&#8217;t have lots of overheads that we need to cover with our prices!</p>
<p>But the success and development of our businesses did not stop there. As with many other independent businesses, over time they often realise there is a proportion of the market that they are not successfully capturing. Naked Kitchens understood this, and developed Naked Doors, who manufacture the bespoke doors and drawer fronts that are seen on a Naked Kitchen. This enabled us to capture the proportion of the market who want a bespoke kitchen, but do not have the budget to renovate the whole kitchen, as these customers can place our bespoke doors and fronts onto their existing kitchen cabinets. There are many other projects in the pipeline for our companies, as we never want to stand-still and stagnate and are constantly trying to disrupt the industry with innovative products. Between the three current companies, there is an option to ensure that every person in the market can achieve some sort of designer look kitchen, whatever their situation or budget.<img class="alignnone" src="https://mail.google.com/mail/u/0?ui=2&amp;ik=33f29f0f64&amp;attid=0.3&amp;th=15fd8cc6575e317a&amp;view=fimg&amp;disp=thd&amp;attbid=ANGjdJ_e6KekEPG2U6BCzZYm8UTIL2iprvuiMoY_drc7502g2tZ8q_SUlKjpsPr3PMmXz1Qy8lgU_-82DaaKxoP_DYSmR0Efs64pgTm1VjXx2abFwk6Nu_w3-GDQfxM&amp;ats=2524608000000&amp;sz=w2538-h1277" alt="Displaying IMG_0645.JPG" width="1600" height="1200" /></p>
<p>So it is quite easy to see why Naked Kitchens was chosen. There is no doubt that as a company, we really have started at the beginning, and built up more than one successful company after discovering a niche gap within the market. A company built on impressive morals, they are FSC certified and create as minimal waste for the environment as possible, not only have the directors created such a successful business, they have done it ethically too.</p>
<p>As one of only two speakers at this event it is clear how special Naked Kitchens story really is. The event was invite only, and any business that was invited was chosen because they are dedicated to growing their company and HSBC knew that the Naked Kitchens success story is one that would inspire other companies to follow the same route.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A highlight of 2017 that we haven&#8217;t yet shared with everyone is that Naked Kitchens has been invited to contribute to the 2017 <em>Parliamentary Review</em> for the Manufacturing Industry.</p>
<p>Sister company to Norfolk Oak, experts in solid hardwoods, Naked Kitchens are a leading manufacturer of fully bespoke kitchens. Until Naked Kitchens, the concept of an excellent bespoke product which more than challenged the very top end, but at a sensible price, was seen as unattainable. With the incredible reputation of Norfolk Oak behind it, the development of Naked Kitchens was the chance for a completely clean and fresh start, to really inject the industry with some new innovative thinking. We have a deep respect for the wood we use, a commitment to sustainable forestry and the crafting of long-lasting products with minimal waste.</p>

<p>The <em>Parliamentary Review</em> combines political commentary from leading journalists, with sector specific insight from Secretaries of State, Ministers and MP&#8217;s. It is an indispensable guide to industry best practice, which demonstrates how sector leaders have responded to challenges in the political and economic environment. <em>The Parliamentary Review</em> is sent to over 250,000 leading business executives and policy-makers. In recent years, it has featured forewords by David Cameron, George Osborne and Philip Hammond.</p>
<p>Naked Kitchen&#8217;s contribution to the review highlights how Naked Kitchens have completely changed the kitchen marketplace by offering a high end quality product at a much lower price point, and also how political instability can really impact a business. The owner of Naked Kitchens, Jamie Everett is absolutely delighted to have been invited to contribute to the review and delivers the message that &#8216;the real key to our success is to innovatively disrupt convention at every turn.&#8217;</p>
<p>The review is to be released in September 2017, and will be sent to thousands of business owners within the industry. The Review&#8217;s release is marked by an annual gala in the Palace of Westminster.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>It’s early o’clock, dew still on the ground, but Naked Kitchens creative director Jayne Everett and photographer Malcolm Menzies are already hard at work on their photoshoot in deepest Norfolk.  You couldn’t make up a more idyllic setting for someone’s dream country kitchen  &#8211;  an old vicarage in the heart of the Broads.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-280" src="https://www.nakedkitchens.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/sites/8/2017/06/norfolk-vicarige-2.jpg" alt="" width="1000" height="1500" srcset="https://www.nakedkitchens.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/sites/8/2017/06/norfolk-vicarige-2.jpg 1000w, https://www.nakedkitchens.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/sites/8/2017/06/norfolk-vicarige-2-200x300.jpg 200w, https://www.nakedkitchens.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/sites/8/2017/06/norfolk-vicarige-2-768x1152.jpg 768w, https://www.nakedkitchens.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/sites/8/2017/06/norfolk-vicarige-2-683x1024.jpg 683w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /><span id="more-274"></span></p>
<p>But it&#8217;s all real. Real house, real homeowners, real Naked Kitchen. Our very latest, to be precise, commissioned by a busy professional couple who love to cook and who entertain like it&#8217;s going out of fashion.  The kitchen  – no prizes for guessing that we’re calling it The Norfolk Vicarage &#8211;  is spacy and breezy, spritzing the innocence of the Shaker classic with a chilled new twist.</p>
<p>If anyone can shoot this breeziness to show off the kitchen in all its brilliance, then it’s award-winning Malcolm. He’s the ideal lensman for Naked Kitchens, completely grasping the earthy yet edgy ethos underlying our work, our respect for wood and our way of harnessing hi-tech to use natural materials sustainably and without waste. Hailing from the remote island of Iona, Malcolm is no stranger to the wild side, although he’s now based in London with a reputation for catching some of the capital’s most iconic and sophisticated brands, interiors and lifestyles.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-281" src="https://www.nakedkitchens.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/sites/8/2017/06/norfolk-vicarige-3.jpg" alt="" width="1500" height="1399" srcset="https://www.nakedkitchens.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/sites/8/2017/06/norfolk-vicarige-3.jpg 1500w, https://www.nakedkitchens.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/sites/8/2017/06/norfolk-vicarige-3-300x280.jpg 300w, https://www.nakedkitchens.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/sites/8/2017/06/norfolk-vicarige-3-768x716.jpg 768w, https://www.nakedkitchens.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/sites/8/2017/06/norfolk-vicarige-3-1024x955.jpg 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 1500px) 100vw, 1500px" /></p>
<p>We’re proud of The Norfolk Vicarage and we can’t wait to see how Malcolm’s artistry reveals its personality. So much heart and soul gets poured into creating our kitchens, and launching any one of them is a huge deal.   Suddenly, we’re seeing the kitchen through someone else’s eyes and it’s exciting and nerve-wracking all at the same time.</p>
<p>As the Norfolk Vicarage couple love entertaining so much, their new kitchen was crafted to be the very hub of the home, offering both welcome and wow factor to their many guests. In a svelte fusion of ancient and modern, we worked around period features like the chimney breast and narrow windows to bring the necessary fluency and circulation to an area that is often both entrance and living room of the house.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-282" src="https://www.nakedkitchens.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/sites/8/2017/06/norfolk-vicarige-before-after.jpg" alt="" width="1500" height="1125" srcset="https://www.nakedkitchens.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/sites/8/2017/06/norfolk-vicarige-before-after.jpg 1500w, https://www.nakedkitchens.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/sites/8/2017/06/norfolk-vicarige-before-after-300x225.jpg 300w, https://www.nakedkitchens.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/sites/8/2017/06/norfolk-vicarige-before-after-768x576.jpg 768w, https://www.nakedkitchens.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/sites/8/2017/06/norfolk-vicarige-before-after-1024x768.jpg 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 1500px) 100vw, 1500px" /></p>
<p>It all came together smoothly &#8211; and what was once a rather dark space is now bright and joyous, with a stunning sweep of antiqued glass behind the Aga spreading its radiance over worktops of white Carrara quartz and giving a friendly sparkle to the carefully-positioned glazed cabinets</p>
<p>It’s a kitchen with all kinds of tailored elegance:  putting the cocktails in Shaker, we love the host’s area with its smart little sink &#8211; for icing and slicing the G&amp;Ts &#8211;  a glasses cupboard, and cabinet for storing wine and mixers.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-279" src="https://www.nakedkitchens.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/sites/8/2017/06/norfolk-vicarige-1.jpg" alt="home cocktail bar" width="1055" height="1500" srcset="https://www.nakedkitchens.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/sites/8/2017/06/norfolk-vicarige-1.jpg 1055w, https://www.nakedkitchens.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/sites/8/2017/06/norfolk-vicarige-1-211x300.jpg 211w, https://www.nakedkitchens.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/sites/8/2017/06/norfolk-vicarige-1-768x1092.jpg 768w, https://www.nakedkitchens.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/sites/8/2017/06/norfolk-vicarige-1-720x1024.jpg 720w" sizes="(max-width: 1055px) 100vw, 1055px" /></p>
<p>There are stowaway trays of sleek grained wood, pegboard crockery dividers in the solid oak drawers, a vegetable preparation sink, cupboards with bifold doors that open generously to the full depth of the worktop, and a deep overhang on the island, allowing friends to lean in comfortably, instead of perching awkwardly on their stools with nowhere to put their knees.</p>
<p>The photoshoot takes about ten hours, but it’s fascinating to glimpse how Malcolm’s keen eye picks angles and lighting that catch the essence of this lovely new kitchen.  We can’t wait to launch it now – so, as they say, watch this space.  Or rather, the fresh new space of The Norfolk Vicarage Kitchen….</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Last weekend in every major city of Great Britain, thousands of brave men and women have taken part in <a href="http://www.swimathon.org/">Swimathon</a>, dusting off their swimming gear and diving straight into the challenge of swimming to a variety of distances, from 1.5 kilometres to 5 kilometres.</p>
<p>This is all to raise money for <a href="https://www.mariecurie.org.uk/">Marie Curie</a>, the leading care providing charity that supports over 40,000 people with terminal illness. Marie Curie practise what they preach, regularly researching into the best way of caring for someone at the end of their life, among all the other amazing things they do day-today. This fantastic charity and the service they provide is completely free of charge to patients and their families.</p>
<div class="pivotx-wrapper"><img class="pivotx-image" title="swim 5" src="https://www.nakedkitchens.com/blog/images/2015-04/swimathon-5.jpg" alt="swim 5" /></div>

<p><span id="more-28"></span></p>
<p>Our bespoke kitchen designer, Jessie wanted to help out and so took the plunge. Being a member of the NAKED Kitchens team, she didn’t want to do things by half and ticked the box to do the full 5 kilometres!</p>
<div class="pivotx-wrapper"><img class="pivotx-image" title="swim 2" src="https://www.nakedkitchens.com/blog/images/2015-04/swimathon-2_1.jpg" alt="swim 2" /></div>
<p>On the day, there were some pre-event nerves which were calmed with a good ol’ cup of tea, and then it was time to head to the poolside.</p>
<div class="pivotx-wrapper"><img class="pivotx-image" title="swim 4" src="https://www.nakedkitchens.com/blog/images/2015-04/swimathon-4.jpg" alt="swim 4" /></div>
<p>The whistle went and Jessie began the mountainous task of completing her 200 lengths. She swam consistent times and completed the lengths in just over an hour and 45 minutes, being the first of the 5 kilometre swimmers to finish! A fantastic achievement since she had only began training a fortnight before. In doing so, with a little help from NAKED Kitchens, Jessie raised over £500 for Marie Curie. Not too shabby…</p>
<div class="pivotx-wrapper"><img class="pivotx-image" title="swimathon 3" src="https://www.nakedkitchens.com/blog/images/2015-04/swimathon-3.jpg" alt="swimathon 3" /></div>
<p>Then, in true Norfolk style, it was off to the pub with family and friends for a much needed pub lunch!</p>
<div class="pivotx-wrapper"><img class="pivotx-image" title="swimathon 1" src="https://www.nakedkitchens.com/blog/images/2015-04/10572190_10153646414303943_4689043836991595554_o.jpg" alt="swimathon 1" /></div>
<p>Congratulations to Jessie!</p>

<p>With a long and rich history of precision engineering, high quality materials and distinctive design, Miele established “Immer Besser” or “Forever Better” as their motto. Since 1899 it has been committed to continuously innovating domestic appliances and manufacturing them to the highest standards. Family-owned and family-run, Miele has become a household name, leading the premium domestic appliance industry from their global headquarters in Gutersloh, Germany.</p>
<p><span id="more-31"></span></p>
<p>Miele was therefore the perfect match for NAKED Kitchens; our state-of-the-art manufacturing and precision engineered ethos creates hand-finished <a href="http://www.nakedkitchens.com/kitchens">bespoke kitchens</a> built to aerospace tolerances. Beautiful design on the outside, innovation and engineered structural integrity on the inside. Talking to one of our designers about your appliances ensures a fundamental part of your kitchen is elegantly worked into the design as well as taking the strain of finding suitable appliances off of you.</p>
<div class="pivotx-wrapper"><img class="pivotx-image" title="miele oven in bespoke white kitchen" src="https://www.nakedkitchens.com/blog/images/2015-03/miele-ovens-white-kitchen.jpg" alt="miele oven in bespoke white kitchen" /></div>
<p>To introduce you to our Miele range, here’s a selection of innovative Miele appliances with features that have caught my eye:</p>
<p><strong>Steam Ovens</strong></p>
<p>The Miele built-in steam ovens contain large crystal displays and sensor controls for greater ease of use. The automatic programmes even let you cook completely stress-free as they intelligently manage the oven’s time and temperature of your favourite dishes.</p>
<div class="pivotx-wrapper"><img class="pivotx-image" title="miele steam oven in kitchen" src="https://www.nakedkitchens.com/blog/images/2015-03/miele-steam-oven-kitchen.jpg" alt="miele steam oven in kitchen" /></div>
<p>The quick MultiSteam system generates its own steam and injects it into the oven at multiple inlets for even temperature distribution, ensuring you create delicious gourmet meals in no time at all.</p>

<p><strong>Conventional Ovens</strong></p>
<p>Our ultra-stylish range of Miele ovens is a natural choice for the design conscious.</p>

<p>The ovens feature clever Pyrolytic technology that cleans the oven for you via an computer controlled intense heat cycle, saving you the hassle. It means you can get on with other things or perhaps gives you the opportunity to brush up on your baking!</p>
<div class="pivotx-wrapper"><img class="pivotx-image" title="miele cleaning oven" src="https://www.nakedkitchens.com/blog/images/2015-03/miele-pyrolytic-oven.jpg" alt="miele cleaning oven" /></div>

<p><strong>Fridge Freezers</strong></p>
<p>The intelligently designed fridge / freezer combinations feature clever touches for complete ease of use. We have found that many of our customers have pets, some of which even joined us on our photo-shoots.</p>
<div class="pivotx-wrapper"><img class="pivotx-image" title="bespoke kitchen cat" src="https://www.nakedkitchens.com/blog/images/2015-03/bespoke-kitchen-cat.jpg" alt="bespoke kitchen cat" /></div>
<p>We know that pet food can produce quite the smell so the Active AirClean filters within a Miele refrigerator are ideal, helping absorb any unpleasant odours, keeping your food completely fresh.</p>
<div class="pivotx-wrapper"><img class="pivotx-image" title="miele fridge freezer in kitchen" src="https://www.nakedkitchens.com/blog/images/2015-03/miele-refrigerator-active-airclean.jpg" alt="miele fridge freezer in kitchen" /></div>
<p><strong>Hobs</strong></p>
<p>Pioneering the connected kitchen, our range of Miele hobs feature Con@ctivity 2.0, an ingenious feature that, when using your hob, automatically turns on and adjusts your Miele cooker hood, letting you get on with the most important task of cooking!</p>
<div class="pivotx-wrapper"><img class="pivotx-image" title="miele hob in kitchen" src="https://www.nakedkitchens.com/blog/images/2015-03/miele-conctivity-hob-cooker-hood.jpg" alt="miele hob in kitchen" /></div>
<p><strong>Wine Coolers</strong></p>
<p>Finally, the drink that makes every meal an occasion and every table more elegant has also been catered for. The Miele selection of contemporary wine coolers offers precisely controlled temperature zones allowing you to store your red, white and rose in one unit. State-of-the-art compressors run efficiently without vibrating, ensuring the sediment in the bottle isn’t disturbed. Bottoms up!</p>
<div class="pivotx-wrapper"><img class="pivotx-image" title="miele wine cooler refrigerator" src="https://www.nakedkitchens.com/blog/images/2015-03/miele-wine-cooler-fridge.jpg" alt="miele wine cooler refrigerator" /></div>
