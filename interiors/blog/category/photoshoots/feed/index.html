				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The Surrey Malthouse is a project that we actually completed back in 2015. This kitchen is one of our larger contemporary kitchens that has some incredibly beautiful and unique design elements. Painted in two different, but incredibly similar shades of dark blue; there is no doubt that this is a statement kitchen. Beautifully framed and softened by Oak accents this blue kitchen remains calm and serene, and the perfect space to spend time in as a family. By incorporating every element except the large stainless steel appliances into a blue colour scheme, it ensures that the senses are not overwhelmed.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone wp-image-690 size-large" src="https://www.nakedkitchens.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/sites/8/2017/11/MG_4834-Edit-1024x683.jpg" alt="" width="640" height="427" srcset="https://www.nakedkitchens.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/sites/8/2017/11/MG_4834-Edit-1024x683.jpg 1024w, https://www.nakedkitchens.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/sites/8/2017/11/MG_4834-Edit-300x200.jpg 300w, https://www.nakedkitchens.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/sites/8/2017/11/MG_4834-Edit-768x512.jpg 768w, https://www.nakedkitchens.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/sites/8/2017/11/MG_4834-Edit.jpg 1500w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" /></p>
<p><span id="more-682"></span></p>
<p>The large Oak handles on each cabinet add the most incredibly luxurious warmth to this kitchen, with no chance of ever being lost on these bold cabinets. A statement in themselves, the Oak accents used throughout the kitchen add an incredible natural earthiness to what would otherwise be a very modern kitchen design. This also nods to the fact that this is the hub of a family home, ensuring it doesn&#8217;t ever feel too contemporary and still feels very welcoming to anyone who visits.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone wp-image-691 size-large" src="https://www.nakedkitchens.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/sites/8/2017/11/MG_4843-Edit-683x1024.jpg" alt="" width="640" height="960" srcset="https://www.nakedkitchens.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/sites/8/2017/11/MG_4843-Edit-683x1024.jpg 683w, https://www.nakedkitchens.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/sites/8/2017/11/MG_4843-Edit-200x300.jpg 200w, https://www.nakedkitchens.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/sites/8/2017/11/MG_4843-Edit-768x1152.jpg 768w, https://www.nakedkitchens.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/sites/8/2017/11/MG_4843-Edit.jpg 1000w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" /></p>
<p>A central island wrapped in beautiful London Grey Caesarstone Quartz and Oak, this island is an eye catching feature that beautifully breaks up the large amount of blue cabinetry. As the island is actually a lighter colour than the cabinets, by framing it in a bright white quartz it keeps the kitchen bright and actually helps to keep the kitchen feeling spacious and open, despite the tall cabinets down one whole side of the room that would potentially make the room feel closed in.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone wp-image-692 size-large" src="https://www.nakedkitchens.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/sites/8/2017/11/MG_4844-Edit-683x1024.jpg" alt="" width="640" height="960" srcset="https://www.nakedkitchens.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/sites/8/2017/11/MG_4844-Edit-683x1024.jpg 683w, https://www.nakedkitchens.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/sites/8/2017/11/MG_4844-Edit-200x300.jpg 200w, https://www.nakedkitchens.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/sites/8/2017/11/MG_4844-Edit-768x1152.jpg 768w, https://www.nakedkitchens.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/sites/8/2017/11/MG_4844-Edit.jpg 1000w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" /></p>
<p>Clean lines are created by the statement Oak handles in this kitchen which perfectly accentuates the frameless cabinets with slab doors. As this kitchen is actually in the lower floor of this house, by using Slab doors it ensures that as much light is reflected throughout the room as possible, as there is minimal natural light for such a large room.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone wp-image-693 size-large" src="https://www.nakedkitchens.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/sites/8/2017/11/MG_4851-Edit-683x1024.jpg" alt="" width="640" height="960" srcset="https://www.nakedkitchens.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/sites/8/2017/11/MG_4851-Edit-683x1024.jpg 683w, https://www.nakedkitchens.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/sites/8/2017/11/MG_4851-Edit-200x300.jpg 200w, https://www.nakedkitchens.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/sites/8/2017/11/MG_4851-Edit-768x1152.jpg 768w, https://www.nakedkitchens.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/sites/8/2017/11/MG_4851-Edit.jpg 1000w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" /></p>
<p>Blue Pendant Lights add a beautiful soft focus above the island, which is perfect for the dining area that has been created in the centre of the kitchen. As the room is so large, having a dining area ensures that the room is utilised and that the kitchen becomes a sociable area that is the hub of the home.</p>
<p>Complimenting the clean lines of this kitchen are the sleek appliances. With minimal appliances on show, the large fridge freezer is subtly positioned in the large cupboard unit, meaning it doesn&#8217;t look out of place or bulky in anyway, and ensures the kitchen remains as beautiful as possible. The large Rangemaster cooker and stainless steel splashback continue this sleek theme, and whilst being a different statement element to the kitchen, it still fits in beautifully.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone wp-image-694 size-large" src="https://www.nakedkitchens.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/sites/8/2017/11/MG_4854-Edit-683x1024.jpg" alt="" width="640" height="960" srcset="https://www.nakedkitchens.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/sites/8/2017/11/MG_4854-Edit-683x1024.jpg 683w, https://www.nakedkitchens.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/sites/8/2017/11/MG_4854-Edit-200x300.jpg 200w, https://www.nakedkitchens.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/sites/8/2017/11/MG_4854-Edit-768x1152.jpg 768w, https://www.nakedkitchens.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/sites/8/2017/11/MG_4854-Edit.jpg 1000w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" /></p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>We always love it when our beautiful kitchens get noticed by people. Whilst we try to share as many images as possible of our kitchens, we are sure that there will still be people who have not seen our kitchens<b>!</b> So when local interiors company Birdie Fortescue contacted us to see if they could use our show room as the backdrop for photos of their spring/summer collection, we didn&#8217;t hesitate to say yes, as this is a brilliant way to show off our incredible kitchens through a new channel!</p>
<p><img src="https://pbs.twimg.com/media/DQx9P_1VoAAfww-.jpg:large" /></p>
<p><span id="more-777"></span></p>
<p>Birdie Fortescue is an interiors business based in Burnham Market, with a shop and website, selling an eclectic mix of both painted and polished antique furniture, all of which are united by the same understated elegance and charm, and contemporary homeware, picked by Birdie herself, from far-flung corners of the globe. We were absolutely delighted to have a company that we often use for styling inspiration want to use our kitchens!</p>
<p><img src="https://pbs.twimg.com/media/DTBaQBbXUAIifs3.jpg:large" /></p>
<p>Birdie got in contact with us to see if they would be able to use our showroom kitchens as a background for their spring/summer collection of tableware. As both of our companies are incredibly contemporary, and strive to break the norms of interiors and design, we knew that it would be a brilliant fit. With Birdie styling the shoot herself, and our stunning kitchens shining with beauty in the background, there was no doubt that this photoshoot was going to result in some incredibly beautiful images.</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/2601/7430/files/naked-kitchens-6.jpg" /></p>
<p>With the launch of their new website, Birdie Fortescue will be releasing these images to coincide with their latest collection landing. We&#8217;ve seen a few sneak peaks of the images before the new website was launched, as we couldn&#8217;t wait for everyone to see them as they look incredible! The items in the collection would look great in any kitchen, but there is no doubt that they particularly shine within our beautiful kitchen designs.</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/2601/7430/files/naked-kitchens-5.jpg" /></p>
<p>Check out our <a href="http://instagram.com/nakedkitchens">Instagram </a>and <a href="http://twitter.com/nakedkitchens">Twitter </a>for more pictures of our kitchens, and Birdie&#8217;s blog <a href="https://birdiefortescue.co.uk/blogs/blog/on-location-with-naked-kitchens-norfolk">post</a> which has more beautiful images, and why not check out their incredible product range on their brand new website!</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>As with most companies, the lead up to Christmas is one of the busiest times of the year for us. We always try to ensure that our customers get their kitchens before Christmas, so that they can enjoy this festive period of the year in their new kitchen.</p>
<p>At this time of the year, we love to see how our customers have dressed their kitchens for Christmas as we always think a kitchen looks even more special with some festive decorations! So we asked our customers who have purchased a Naked Kitchen this year, to send us in a few snaps of their room at Christmas so we can share with you our beautiful kitchen designs with a festive twist!</p>
<p><img class="alignnone wp-image-801 size-large" src="https://www.nakedkitchens.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/sites/8/2017/12/old-forge-kitchen-1-1024x683.jpg" alt="" width="640" height="427" srcset="https://www.nakedkitchens.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/sites/8/2017/12/old-forge-kitchen-1-1024x683.jpg 1024w, https://www.nakedkitchens.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/sites/8/2017/12/old-forge-kitchen-1-300x200.jpg 300w, https://www.nakedkitchens.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/sites/8/2017/12/old-forge-kitchen-1-768x512.jpg 768w, https://www.nakedkitchens.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/sites/8/2017/12/old-forge-kitchen-1.jpg 1500w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" /></p>
<p><span id="more-736"></span></p>
<p><img class="alignnone wp-image-802 size-large" src="https://www.nakedkitchens.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/sites/8/2017/12/old-forge-kitchen-6-1024x683.jpg" alt="" width="640" height="427" srcset="https://www.nakedkitchens.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/sites/8/2017/12/old-forge-kitchen-6-1024x683.jpg 1024w, https://www.nakedkitchens.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/sites/8/2017/12/old-forge-kitchen-6-300x200.jpg 300w, https://www.nakedkitchens.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/sites/8/2017/12/old-forge-kitchen-6-768x512.jpg 768w, https://www.nakedkitchens.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/sites/8/2017/12/old-forge-kitchen-6.jpg 1500w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" /></p>
<p>The Old Forge Kitchen is one of our favourite kitchen designs, as it is so beautifully simple and traditional. The perfect country kitchen, with Shaker cabinets, Oak worktops and a bold painted island, there is no doubt that the beauty of this classic kitchen shines through. Dressed up with some simple festive decorations, this room is elegance epitomised.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone wp-image-812 size-large" src="https://www.nakedkitchens.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/sites/8/2017/12/kitchen-2-1024x768.jpg" alt="" width="640" height="480" srcset="https://www.nakedkitchens.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/sites/8/2017/12/kitchen-2-1024x768.jpg 1024w, https://www.nakedkitchens.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/sites/8/2017/12/kitchen-2-300x225.jpg 300w, https://www.nakedkitchens.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/sites/8/2017/12/kitchen-2-768x576.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" /></p>
<p><img class="alignnone wp-image-813 size-large" src="https://www.nakedkitchens.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/sites/8/2017/12/kitchen-5-1024x680.jpg" alt="" width="640" height="425" srcset="https://www.nakedkitchens.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/sites/8/2017/12/kitchen-5-1024x680.jpg 1024w, https://www.nakedkitchens.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/sites/8/2017/12/kitchen-5-300x199.jpg 300w, https://www.nakedkitchens.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/sites/8/2017/12/kitchen-5-768x510.jpg 768w, https://www.nakedkitchens.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/sites/8/2017/12/kitchen-5.jpg 1549w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" /></p>
<p>The Meadow Kitchen shows how traditional Shaker style can still be used to create a beautiful, contemporary kitchen. Like the Old Forge Kitchen shown above, this room is<strong> </strong>decorated in such a simple and elegant way, allowing the kitchen&#8217;s true beauty to shine through and create a festive wonderland without ever looking over the top.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>We&#8217;re kicking off our latest series on the blog, which focuses on the use of colour, and with what is generally considered the biggest announcement in the colour world. This series will focus mainly on colour within the kitchen, but we will also look broadly at the latest trends in colour!</p>
<p><img src="https://www.designboom.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/pantone-color-of-the-year-2018-ultra-violet-designboom-1800.jpg" alt="Image result for pantone color of the year 2018" /></p>
<p><span id="more-770"></span></p>
<p>So December has come around incredibly quickly, and once again Pantone&#8217;s colour of the year has been announced, and it seems that this year the announcement is more controversial than ever! The colour of 2018- Ultra Violet- is described as: &#8216;Complex and contemplative, Ultra Violet suggests the mysteries of the cosmos, the intrigue of what lies ahead, and the discoveries beyond where we are now.&#8217;</p>
<p>Definitely a controversial choice from Pantone, and whilst it lies in the same &#8216;bright, jewel-like tones&#8217; as the 2017 colour of the year &#8216;Greenery&#8217;, this colour doesn&#8217;t make as much sense to a lot of interior specialists and bloggers. With Greenery being linked to nature, it was really quite easy to bring this into the household, whereas many are struggling to see where Pantone will fit into their homes.</p>
<p>A very bold colour that will definitely only work when used in a certain way, but it&#8217;s difficult to see this ever being used as the main colour of a room. With many describing this colour as incredibly similar to the purple used on Cadbury&#8217;s packaging, it&#8217;s possible that we may not see as much of this colour in 2018 interiors as we are used to with all of Pantone&#8217;s other colour choices.</p>
<p>This colour is bright and bold, and is also very different to the &#8216;rich, earthy&#8217; colours that we have been loving recently. But whilst we and many others remain quite sceptical for the moment, we&#8217;re certainly not ruling out the potential that Ultra Violet has, and we&#8217;re sure that it will actually look incredibly beautiful when used in the right way!<img class="alignnone wp-image-629 size-large" src="https://www.nakedkitchens.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/sites/8/2017/10/kia-designs-8-1024x666.jpg" alt="" width="640" height="416" srcset="https://www.nakedkitchens.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/sites/8/2017/10/kia-designs-8-1024x666.jpg 1024w, https://www.nakedkitchens.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/sites/8/2017/10/kia-designs-8-300x195.jpg 300w, https://www.nakedkitchens.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/sites/8/2017/10/kia-designs-8-768x500.jpg 768w, https://www.nakedkitchens.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/sites/8/2017/10/kia-designs-8.jpg 1500w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" /></p>
<p>At Naked Kitchens we&#8217;re particularly fond of using a bold colour in the kitchen. Our Highbury Kitchen uses the beautiful Dulux Storyteller to create a statement island in this colourful yet compact design. We particularly love the rich, jewel tones of the purple used and by using the colour on one element of the kitchen, this is a perfect way for people to inject Ultra Violet into their kitchens.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>One design element that we often recommend to our clients here at Naked Kitchens is to have a splashback in the kitchen. Splashbacks can be added as a feature in a beautiful kitchen, or as protection for walls from splashing pots and pans or taps, as they are often easily wipe able and easy to maintain. Some of our favourite kitchen designs we have ever created have splashbacks in them, and each looks completely unique in its own way, with the splashback adding an incredible eye catching feature.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone wp-image-639 size-large" src="https://www.nakedkitchens.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/sites/8/2017/10/brixton-6-683x1024.jpg" alt="" width="640" height="960" srcset="https://www.nakedkitchens.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/sites/8/2017/10/brixton-6-683x1024.jpg 683w, https://www.nakedkitchens.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/sites/8/2017/10/brixton-6-200x300.jpg 200w, https://www.nakedkitchens.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/sites/8/2017/10/brixton-6-768x1152.jpg 768w, https://www.nakedkitchens.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/sites/8/2017/10/brixton-6.jpg 1000w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" /></p>
<p><span id="more-634"></span></p>
<p>One of our most memorable designs, and also one of our most liked on social media is the Ladbroke Kitchen and its bronze splashback. An item that we created by hand, one evening in the directors kitchen no less, the bronze splashback has certainly gained some attention since we released the photos of this kitchen design. Antiqued by hand, every splashback we make is completely unique and made to order. So far, we have only experimented with this metal, but we are looking to incorporate other metals into our designs in the future. The bronze splashback combines beautifully with the other bronze elements within this design, and reflects light around the room, making it seem much larger than it is.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone wp-image-208 size-large" src="https://www.nakedkitchens.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/sites/8/2016/10/ladbrooke-2-683x1024.jpg" alt="" width="640" height="960" srcset="https://www.nakedkitchens.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/sites/8/2016/10/ladbrooke-2-683x1024.jpg 683w, https://www.nakedkitchens.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/sites/8/2016/10/ladbrooke-2-200x300.jpg 200w, https://www.nakedkitchens.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/sites/8/2016/10/ladbrooke-2-768x1152.jpg 768w, https://www.nakedkitchens.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/sites/8/2016/10/ladbrooke-2.jpg 1000w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" /></p>
<p>The antiqued foxed glass splashback in the Norfolk Vicarage Kitchen is especially fabulous. Behind the large stately AGA, this splashback makes a stunning statement. Despite being located in the area of the kitchen that has the least natural light and has the tendency to feel quite dark and closed off, the splashback actually reflects light from the beautiful garden, making the room feel open, spacious and incredibly light. A material that is potentially not the most practical, behind such a large source of heat, the glass will be easy to wipe and clean surface stains. The antiqued nature of the glass fits in perfectly with the traditional shaker kitchen in this listed building.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone wp-image-635 size-large" src="https://www.nakedkitchens.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/sites/8/2017/10/norfolk-vicarage-7-683x1024.jpg" alt="" width="640" height="960" srcset="https://www.nakedkitchens.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/sites/8/2017/10/norfolk-vicarage-7-683x1024.jpg 683w, https://www.nakedkitchens.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/sites/8/2017/10/norfolk-vicarage-7-200x300.jpg 200w, https://www.nakedkitchens.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/sites/8/2017/10/norfolk-vicarage-7-768x1152.jpg 768w, https://www.nakedkitchens.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/sites/8/2017/10/norfolk-vicarage-7.jpg 1000w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" /></p>
<p>This compact kitchen makes the most of its beautiful marble splashback. By having dark cabinetry and a very light coloured splashback and white wall cabinets, it keeps the eye-level of the kitchen bright and light, meaning it feels open and spacious, and never closed off, making the most of natural light. The Faraday Road kitchen is the perfect design for compact spaces. With minimal cabinetry, the marble splashback lends itself to making the statement for this kitchen design. Subtle and classic, this splashback isn&#8217;t ostentatious and doesn&#8217;t overpower such a small space. Matching the worktop, this splashback adds to the clean lines of the room and ensures everything remains sleek and sophisticated.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone wp-image-637 size-full" src="https://www.nakedkitchens.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/sites/8/2017/10/Faraday-Road-4.jpg" alt="" width="3600" height="2403" srcset="https://www.nakedkitchens.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/sites/8/2017/10/Faraday-Road-4.jpg 3600w, https://www.nakedkitchens.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/sites/8/2017/10/Faraday-Road-4-300x200.jpg 300w, https://www.nakedkitchens.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/sites/8/2017/10/Faraday-Road-4-768x513.jpg 768w, https://www.nakedkitchens.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/sites/8/2017/10/Faraday-Road-4-1024x684.jpg 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 3600px) 100vw, 3600px" /></p>
<p>The contrast in this kitchen is what makes this splashback work so well. Already a striking kitchen that makes a bold statement, the addition of the mottled grey tiles as a splashback makes this kitchen like no other. The Westbourne Gardens kitchen design is so unique, and whilst the splashback contrasts so dramatically, it actually works incredibly well. If you were to have a plainer, more simple splashback it would simply be lost against such bold cabinetry and handles, whereas you cannot deny this splashback instantly catches your eye. Easily cleaned and an incredibly durable material, these tiles add to the wondrous atmosphere of the room.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone wp-image-636 size-large" src="https://www.nakedkitchens.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/sites/8/2017/10/6-683x1024.jpg" alt="" width="640" height="960" srcset="https://www.nakedkitchens.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/sites/8/2017/10/6-683x1024.jpg 683w, https://www.nakedkitchens.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/sites/8/2017/10/6-200x300.jpg 200w, https://www.nakedkitchens.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/sites/8/2017/10/6-768x1152.jpg 768w, https://www.nakedkitchens.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/sites/8/2017/10/6.jpg 936w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" /><br />

<p>Finally, one of our more slightly more subtle designs but still incredibly stunning, is our Brancaster Marshes kitchen. The use of the antiqued glass as a splashback adds a beautiful element to this kitchen design, and ensures that light bounces around the room, making it feel bright and open. Having such a reflective splashback combined with floating shelves ensures that the room doesn&#8217;t feel like a sea of cabinetry. It keeps the eye-level of the room as light as possible, and also provides an interesting view for those sitting at the island. Glass is easy to clean but the antiqued nature of this particular piece means that you don&#8217;t have to worry about keeping it impossibly clean and smear-free.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>So we&#8217;re kicking off our latest series on this blog post with a post all about using brass in your kitchen in the most sophisticated and beautiful way. With a series of &#8216;mood board&#8217; images, you can see how we would incorporate brass into a kitchen design, and what other colours and timbers we would use to really maximise the statement this metal makes and create a beautiful kitchen. This particular combination was created by the creative director at Naked Kitchens, and is actually part of the inspiration behind one of our new showroom kitchens coming soon!</p>
<p><img class="alignnone wp-image-678 size-large" src="https://www.nakedkitchens.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/sites/8/2017/11/mood-board-2-1024x683.jpg" alt="" width="640" height="427" srcset="https://www.nakedkitchens.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/sites/8/2017/11/mood-board-2-1024x683.jpg 1024w, https://www.nakedkitchens.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/sites/8/2017/11/mood-board-2-300x200.jpg 300w, https://www.nakedkitchens.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/sites/8/2017/11/mood-board-2-768x512.jpg 768w, https://www.nakedkitchens.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/sites/8/2017/11/mood-board-2.jpg 1500w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" /></p>
<p><span id="more-674"></span><br />
Since creating our <a href="https://www.nakedkitchens.com/kitchens/frameless/ladbroke">Ladbroke</a> kitchen, we just can&#8217;t get enough of using antiqued brass splashbacks, and with good reason. They are simply stunning! As the brass splashback is such a feature element of any kitchen, we always recommend to keep the rest of the kitchen natural and earthy by using natural timbers and rich paint colours, to ensure the room never looks over the top despite the bright feature.</p>
<p>The contrast of the dark, sophisticated Walnut means that the brass can take centre stage in this design without fighting for attention. The metallic detailing would also flow throughout the kitchen with the sleek brass handles, which beautifully compliment the splashback and ensures the focus is never far from this metal. Brass also pairs incredibly well with the beautifully blue green paint sample, as it stands out much more than traditional silver or nickel handles would.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone wp-image-676 size-large" src="https://www.nakedkitchens.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/sites/8/2017/11/mood-board-5-1024x683.jpg" alt="" width="640" height="427" srcset="https://www.nakedkitchens.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/sites/8/2017/11/mood-board-5-1024x683.jpg 1024w, https://www.nakedkitchens.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/sites/8/2017/11/mood-board-5-300x200.jpg 300w, https://www.nakedkitchens.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/sites/8/2017/11/mood-board-5-768x512.jpg 768w, https://www.nakedkitchens.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/sites/8/2017/11/mood-board-5.jpg 1500w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" /></p>
<p>The beautifully moody paint colour seen in these photos is Livid by Little Green, and whilst it makes a statement against the sophisticated Walnut and brass accessories, it&#8217;s still subtle enough that it doesn&#8217;t overwhelm your senses, and still allows the bright brass to be the main feature.</p>
<p>You can see the beauty of the timber that we use in our kitchens, and understandably why our kitchens are such high quality, as we use ply as opposed to cheap chipboard. The incredible Walnut gives a sense of sophistication, whilst keeping the colour palette rich and earthy, which is insanely on trend at the moment. The addition of the Carrara Marble helps to keep the room bright and open, which is especially important in a compact room with minimal natural light.</p>
<p>Despite being a beautiful bright contrast to the dark Walnut in this design, the use of Brass as opposed to brighter metals like Gold or Silver actually adds to the softer tones of this design. As the brass splashback has been through an ageing process, it creates beautiful markings which are entirely unique to each piece of brass. This reinforces the bespoke element of a Naked Kitchen, as no kitchen will ever look the same.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone wp-image-677 size-large" src="https://www.nakedkitchens.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/sites/8/2017/11/mood-board-9-683x1024.jpg" alt="" width="640" height="960" srcset="https://www.nakedkitchens.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/sites/8/2017/11/mood-board-9-683x1024.jpg 683w, https://www.nakedkitchens.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/sites/8/2017/11/mood-board-9-200x300.jpg 200w, https://www.nakedkitchens.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/sites/8/2017/11/mood-board-9-768x1152.jpg 768w, https://www.nakedkitchens.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/sites/8/2017/11/mood-board-9.jpg 1000w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" /></p>
<p>We simply love these handles, not only for their subtle Brass colouring, but also for the beautiful grip element, which shows how our Kitchens are not only built for form, but function too.

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Something that most of our clients try to incorporate into their kitchen design, is an island. Whether it be a contemporary kitchen where the island is the main dining area, or a large country kitchen with a bold island design that is perfect for gathering around and socialising with drinks and friends. An island is often an integral part of a kitchen design and can make your room really stand out from the crowd. We&#8217;ve got a few favourites that we&#8217;ve designed over the years and we&#8217;d love to share them with you!</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter wp-image-366 size-large" src="https://www.nakedkitchens.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/sites/8/2017/07/cley-12-683x1024.jpg" alt="" width="640" height="960" srcset="https://www.nakedkitchens.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/sites/8/2017/07/cley-12-683x1024.jpg 683w, https://www.nakedkitchens.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/sites/8/2017/07/cley-12-200x300.jpg 200w, https://www.nakedkitchens.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/sites/8/2017/07/cley-12-768x1152.jpg 768w, https://www.nakedkitchens.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/sites/8/2017/07/cley-12.jpg 1000w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" /></p>
<p><span id="more-626"></span></p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.nakedkitchens.com/kitchens/naked-in-frame/cley">Cley Kitchen</a> is one of our beautifully traditional kitchen island designs. Situated in a large country kitchen, the island in this kitchen design is definitely the social point of the room. The perfect area for socialising with friends and drinks, or gathering children for a quick supper. An integrated wine fridge is in the perfect location to make this island incredibly practical, and the end grain work-surface is also incredibly hard wearing. With V-Groove panelling, the island ties the whole open plan room together, helping combine the cooking area with the rest of the kitchen that used dining and relaxing.</p>
<p><img class="wp-image-590 size-large aligncenter" src="https://www.nakedkitchens.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/sites/8/2017/10/brancaster-marshes-6-1024x683.jpg" alt="" width="640" height="427" srcset="https://www.nakedkitchens.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/sites/8/2017/10/brancaster-marshes-6-1024x683.jpg 1024w, https://www.nakedkitchens.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/sites/8/2017/10/brancaster-marshes-6-300x200.jpg 300w, https://www.nakedkitchens.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/sites/8/2017/10/brancaster-marshes-6-768x512.jpg 768w, https://www.nakedkitchens.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/sites/8/2017/10/brancaster-marshes-6.jpg 1500w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" /></p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.nakedkitchens.com/kitchens/frameless/brancaster-marshes">Brancaster Marshes</a> is one of our more contemporary kitchens, and the island is a very large feature point within this design. Perfect for family breakfasts or a relaxing cup of tea with friends in the afternoon, the island instantly grabs the eye as well as being incredibly functional too. With beautiful pendant lighting above, V-groove panelling painted to match other cabinetry within the room and exposed Oak work surfaces, and there is no denying the beauty of this island.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter wp-image-629 size-large" src="https://www.nakedkitchens.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/sites/8/2017/10/kia-designs-8-1024x666.jpg" alt="" width="640" height="416" srcset="https://www.nakedkitchens.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/sites/8/2017/10/kia-designs-8-1024x666.jpg 1024w, https://www.nakedkitchens.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/sites/8/2017/10/kia-designs-8-300x195.jpg 300w, https://www.nakedkitchens.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/sites/8/2017/10/kia-designs-8-768x500.jpg 768w, https://www.nakedkitchens.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/sites/8/2017/10/kia-designs-8.jpg 1500w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" /></p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.nakedkitchens.com/kitchens/frameless/highbury-kitchen">Highland Kitchen</a> is one of our more recent designs, and was focused around family living. Working with <a href="http://www.kiadesigns.co.uk/">Kia Designs</a>, the clients wanted a kitchen that would look incredibly beautiful, whilst being completely functional for a life with small children.</p>
<p>The island in this kitchen design is truly special, as it has a pop-up extractor and multi-burner hob included. This makes the island a focal point in the room and is the perfect place to serve food quickly, straight from the hob to those sitting at the island. Despite the room being relatively compact, by making the island also have a seating area means no space is lost, and the room doesn&#8217;t feel as though there is too much cabinetry. Having the island painted in a bold separate colour, contrasts to the white cabinetry in the room and makes a dramatic statement. <img class="aligncenter wp-image-594 size-full" src="https://www.nakedkitchens.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/sites/8/2017/10/Naked-Kitched-Gayton-5.jpg" alt="" width="750" height="501" srcset="https://www.nakedkitchens.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/sites/8/2017/10/Naked-Kitched-Gayton-5.jpg 750w, https://www.nakedkitchens.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/sites/8/2017/10/Naked-Kitched-Gayton-5-300x200.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 750px) 100vw, 750px" />Finally, the island in the <a href="https://www.nakedkitchens.com/kitchens/naked-in-frame/old-mill">Old Mill kitchen</a> is one of the more functional designs that we have created. With two integrated ovens, an induction hob and seating area, this island really is the perfect addition to a kitchen. The integrated appliances mean there are no bulky elements within the room, and everything looks sleek and sophisticated. By having the island in the middle of the room it allows the person cooking to remain involved with everyone in the room and not feel closed off. As a very clean, simple kitchen design, there are no bold, bright statements being made with this island, but simply functionality and form, showing off the beauty of V-Groove panelling.</p>
<p>If you have the space for an island within your kitchen, we would always recommend it, as it&#8217;s a beautiful area to gather, socialise, dine, drink and do so many things!

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>As you may already know, colour has made quite a dramatic comeback to the kitchen. Gone are the days of an all white kitchen, and whilst neutral greys are still popular in the classic country kitchen styles, there is one colour that has definitely caught our eye recently and a lot of our clients too- the beautiful blue.<br />
Gone are the days when people can spend an obscene amount on a kitchen, and with houses generally decreasing in size alongside budgets, people are generally investing in smaller kitchens. Those who are looking to invest in a new kitchen are often turning to the calming colour blue, and are choosing Naked Kitchens to create the kitchen for them, as they can get a high end quality kitchen without the high end price tag.</p>
<p><strong>Contemporary Compact Kitchens<br />
</strong>Pale pastel blues can look incredible in a smaller space, bouncing light from windows to create the illusion of much more space and keeping the room light and fresh. By choosing such a bright and unusual kitchen colour, the eyes are instantly drawn to the area, and with minimal accessories throughout, there is no distraction from this incredible space.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone wp-image-476 size-large" src="https://www.nakedkitchens.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/sites/8/2017/08/kew-penthouse-1-1024x683.jpg" alt="" width="640" height="427" srcset="https://www.nakedkitchens.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/sites/8/2017/08/kew-penthouse-1-1024x683.jpg 1024w, https://www.nakedkitchens.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/sites/8/2017/08/kew-penthouse-1-300x200.jpg 300w, https://www.nakedkitchens.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/sites/8/2017/08/kew-penthouse-1-768x512.jpg 768w, https://www.nakedkitchens.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/sites/8/2017/08/kew-penthouse-1.jpg 1500w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" /><br />

<p><span id="more-508"></span></p>
<p>Bolder blues can look equally as stunning and keep the room feeling airy and spacious, whilst making a statement that will still look amazing in years to come. Mixing the bright Breton Blue with the incredible Walnut Wide Block worktops creates a beautiful vibe that feels instantly homely, despite being in a cool urban retreat in London. Using shaker style doors on this frameless kitchen creates a seamless design, perfect for the small space it adorns.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone wp-image-509 size-large" src="https://www.nakedkitchens.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/sites/8/2017/09/brixton-1-1024x683.jpg" alt="" width="640" height="427" srcset="https://www.nakedkitchens.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/sites/8/2017/09/brixton-1-1024x683.jpg 1024w, https://www.nakedkitchens.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/sites/8/2017/09/brixton-1-300x200.jpg 300w, https://www.nakedkitchens.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/sites/8/2017/09/brixton-1-768x512.jpg 768w, https://www.nakedkitchens.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/sites/8/2017/09/brixton-1.jpg 1500w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" /></p>

<p>The <a href="http://www.farrow-ball.com/hague%20blue/paint-colours/farrow-ball/fcp-product/100030">Hague Blue</a> cabinets in the Portobello kitchen mix perfectly with the natural Oak cabinets and features, creating a interesting feature between the colour and timber. This mix of blues and oak ensures this area remains fresh and doesn&#8217;t feel boxed in due to it being such a compact area. By keeping the island all timber and bright white quartz, and having a backdrop of blue draws the eye to look at the whole kitchen and not just focus on one part, giving the illusion that the space is larger than it actually is, as each section is different and really holds its own.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone wp-image-477 size-large" src="https://www.nakedkitchens.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/sites/8/2017/08/1-683x1024.jpg" alt="" width="640" height="960" srcset="https://www.nakedkitchens.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/sites/8/2017/08/1-683x1024.jpg 683w, https://www.nakedkitchens.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/sites/8/2017/08/1-200x300.jpg 200w, https://www.nakedkitchens.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/sites/8/2017/08/1-768x1152.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" /></p>
<p><strong>Shaker Kitchens<br />
</strong>And whilst the contemporary kitchens seem to be winning the battle of the blues, that doesn&#8217;t mean large classic shaker kitchens can&#8217;t look just as beautiful with an injection of blue. One of our incredible shaker designs- the Cley Kitchen has incorporated blue into the kitchen in a large way, with a whole section of cabinets painted in the beautiful <a href="http://www.farrow-ball.com/hague%20blue/paint-colours/farrow-ball/fcp-product/100030">Hague Blue</a> (a favourite colour of our clients it would seem). Whilst remaining a beautifully classic kitchen design that will look forever timeless, an injection of colour allows this kitchen to keep up to date with trends and cater to the modern shaker obsession that is taking over.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>It’s early o’clock, dew still on the ground, but Naked Kitchens creative director Jayne Everett and photographer Malcolm Menzies are already hard at work on their photoshoot in deepest Norfolk.  You couldn’t make up a more idyllic setting for someone’s dream country kitchen  &#8211;  an old vicarage in the heart of the Broads.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-280" src="https://www.nakedkitchens.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/sites/8/2017/06/norfolk-vicarige-2.jpg" alt="" width="1000" height="1500" srcset="https://www.nakedkitchens.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/sites/8/2017/06/norfolk-vicarige-2.jpg 1000w, https://www.nakedkitchens.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/sites/8/2017/06/norfolk-vicarige-2-200x300.jpg 200w, https://www.nakedkitchens.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/sites/8/2017/06/norfolk-vicarige-2-768x1152.jpg 768w, https://www.nakedkitchens.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/sites/8/2017/06/norfolk-vicarige-2-683x1024.jpg 683w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /><span id="more-274"></span></p>
<p>But it&#8217;s all real. Real house, real homeowners, real Naked Kitchen. Our very latest, to be precise, commissioned by a busy professional couple who love to cook and who entertain like it&#8217;s going out of fashion.  The kitchen  – no prizes for guessing that we’re calling it The Norfolk Vicarage &#8211;  is spacy and breezy, spritzing the innocence of the Shaker classic with a chilled new twist.</p>
<p>If anyone can shoot this breeziness to show off the kitchen in all its brilliance, then it’s award-winning Malcolm. He’s the ideal lensman for Naked Kitchens, completely grasping the earthy yet edgy ethos underlying our work, our respect for wood and our way of harnessing hi-tech to use natural materials sustainably and without waste. Hailing from the remote island of Iona, Malcolm is no stranger to the wild side, although he’s now based in London with a reputation for catching some of the capital’s most iconic and sophisticated brands, interiors and lifestyles.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-281" src="https://www.nakedkitchens.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/sites/8/2017/06/norfolk-vicarige-3.jpg" alt="" width="1500" height="1399" srcset="https://www.nakedkitchens.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/sites/8/2017/06/norfolk-vicarige-3.jpg 1500w, https://www.nakedkitchens.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/sites/8/2017/06/norfolk-vicarige-3-300x280.jpg 300w, https://www.nakedkitchens.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/sites/8/2017/06/norfolk-vicarige-3-768x716.jpg 768w, https://www.nakedkitchens.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/sites/8/2017/06/norfolk-vicarige-3-1024x955.jpg 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 1500px) 100vw, 1500px" /></p>
<p>We’re proud of The Norfolk Vicarage and we can’t wait to see how Malcolm’s artistry reveals its personality. So much heart and soul gets poured into creating our kitchens, and launching any one of them is a huge deal.   Suddenly, we’re seeing the kitchen through someone else’s eyes and it’s exciting and nerve-wracking all at the same time.</p>
<p>As the Norfolk Vicarage couple love entertaining so much, their new kitchen was crafted to be the very hub of the home, offering both welcome and wow factor to their many guests. In a svelte fusion of ancient and modern, we worked around period features like the chimney breast and narrow windows to bring the necessary fluency and circulation to an area that is often both entrance and living room of the house.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-282" src="https://www.nakedkitchens.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/sites/8/2017/06/norfolk-vicarige-before-after.jpg" alt="" width="1500" height="1125" srcset="https://www.nakedkitchens.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/sites/8/2017/06/norfolk-vicarige-before-after.jpg 1500w, https://www.nakedkitchens.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/sites/8/2017/06/norfolk-vicarige-before-after-300x225.jpg 300w, https://www.nakedkitchens.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/sites/8/2017/06/norfolk-vicarige-before-after-768x576.jpg 768w, https://www.nakedkitchens.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/sites/8/2017/06/norfolk-vicarige-before-after-1024x768.jpg 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 1500px) 100vw, 1500px" /></p>
<p>It all came together smoothly &#8211; and what was once a rather dark space is now bright and joyous, with a stunning sweep of antiqued glass behind the Aga spreading its radiance over worktops of white Carrara quartz and giving a friendly sparkle to the carefully-positioned glazed cabinets</p>
<p>It’s a kitchen with all kinds of tailored elegance:  putting the cocktails in Shaker, we love the host’s area with its smart little sink &#8211; for icing and slicing the G&amp;Ts &#8211;  a glasses cupboard, and cabinet for storing wine and mixers.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-279" src="https://www.nakedkitchens.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/sites/8/2017/06/norfolk-vicarige-1.jpg" alt="home cocktail bar" width="1055" height="1500" srcset="https://www.nakedkitchens.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/sites/8/2017/06/norfolk-vicarige-1.jpg 1055w, https://www.nakedkitchens.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/sites/8/2017/06/norfolk-vicarige-1-211x300.jpg 211w, https://www.nakedkitchens.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/sites/8/2017/06/norfolk-vicarige-1-768x1092.jpg 768w, https://www.nakedkitchens.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/sites/8/2017/06/norfolk-vicarige-1-720x1024.jpg 720w" sizes="(max-width: 1055px) 100vw, 1055px" /></p>
<p>There are stowaway trays of sleek grained wood, pegboard crockery dividers in the solid oak drawers, a vegetable preparation sink, cupboards with bifold doors that open generously to the full depth of the worktop, and a deep overhang on the island, allowing friends to lean in comfortably, instead of perching awkwardly on their stools with nowhere to put their knees.</p>
<p>The photoshoot takes about ten hours, but it’s fascinating to glimpse how Malcolm’s keen eye picks angles and lighting that catch the essence of this lovely new kitchen.  We can’t wait to launch it now – so, as they say, watch this space.  Or rather, the fresh new space of The Norfolk Vicarage Kitchen….</p>
