				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>How can you get a really durable finish on your kitchen cabinetry. Naked Kitchens has the answers.</p>
<p>Do you throw your pasta against the wall to see if it’s done? Getting beautiful kitchen paintwork that can withstand everything life chucks at it &#8211; from chef-propelled linguine to a high velocity football boot &#8211; has always been one of the great challenges for kitchen manufacturers like us.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone wp-image-208 size-full" src="https://www.nakedkitchens.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/sites/8/2016/10/ladbrooke-2.jpg" alt="" width="1000" height="1500" srcset="https://www.nakedkitchens.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/sites/8/2016/10/ladbrooke-2.jpg 1000w, https://www.nakedkitchens.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/sites/8/2016/10/ladbrooke-2-200x300.jpg 200w, https://www.nakedkitchens.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/sites/8/2016/10/ladbrooke-2-768x1152.jpg 768w, https://www.nakedkitchens.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/sites/8/2016/10/ladbrooke-2-683x1024.jpg 683w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>
<p><span id="more-293"></span></p>
<p>That’s why we’re so proud of the robotic sprayline installed here in the Norfolk workshop last summer. Reflecting our fusion of precision engineering and beautiful hand-finishing, it’s an industry-leading innovation that raises paintwork to a stratospheric new level.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-296" src="https://www.nakedkitchens.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/sites/8/2017/07/sprayline.jpg" alt="naked kitchens sprayline" width="1804" height="1000" srcset="https://www.nakedkitchens.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/sites/8/2017/07/sprayline.jpg 1804w, https://www.nakedkitchens.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/sites/8/2017/07/sprayline-300x166.jpg 300w, https://www.nakedkitchens.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/sites/8/2017/07/sprayline-768x426.jpg 768w, https://www.nakedkitchens.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/sites/8/2017/07/sprayline-1024x568.jpg 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 1804px) 100vw, 1804px" /><br />
This is kitchen painting as both art with a capital A and as the appliance of science. Here at Naked Kitchens, we’re harnessing the same technology used to spray luxury cars – and the same secret-recipe paint used by Britain’s nuclear subs to keep out the sea. Truly hi-tech dec.</p>
<p>Traditional paints just don&#8217;t cut it. For most of us, the 21st kitchen is the busiest room of the house. Cabinet surfaces must be resilient enough to weather daily use, year in year out, while looking as sharp and sheened as they did when they were built. That’s why we use highly-specialised two-part coating in four luxurious layers for the most complete finish.</p>
<p>So how is it done? Size isn’t everything but it really does count when you’re trying to create a smooth ski-run finish that dries with no trapped specks or bubbling. And at over 60 metres, our sprayline delivers that single flowing process required.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-298" src="https://www.nakedkitchens.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/sites/8/2017/07/sprayline-door.jpg" alt="" width="1804" height="1000" srcset="https://www.nakedkitchens.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/sites/8/2017/07/sprayline-door.jpg 1804w, https://www.nakedkitchens.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/sites/8/2017/07/sprayline-door-300x166.jpg 300w, https://www.nakedkitchens.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/sites/8/2017/07/sprayline-door-768x426.jpg 768w, https://www.nakedkitchens.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/sites/8/2017/07/sprayline-door-1024x568.jpg 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 1804px) 100vw, 1804px" /><br />
As our hand-finished cabinet doors and panels are conveyed through the machine, four robotic sprayheads deliver precise amounts of paint in the perfect spray pattern.<br />
Then the now gloriously coloured wooden pieces travel through a series of jetted-air drying tunnels and infra-red catalyzers that transform wet pigment into a deep and durable coat. They are finally zapped by ultraviolet radiation so powerful that it would burn three layers of skin off your hand in less than 30 seconds.</p>
<p>Awesome. Who says watching paint dry is boring? And with all that firepower, the finish is unbelievable – putting many of the more traditional methods firmly out of date. After all, who wants paint-stuck dust or bristles from moulting brushes marring their cabinets?</p>
<p>At Naked Kitchens, we’ve made no secret that we’re on a mission to lead our own industry into a future where kitchens are crafted with ever more style and beauty and ever crisper precision. The sprayline is part of our continuing engagement in go-ahead technologies that widen the gap between us and kitchen companies who can’t match the sheer quality of the products we’re so proud to manufacture.</p>
<p>Ultimately, the fabulousness of a 21st century kitchen comes down to how the finished cabinetry looks, feels, performs, and how it lasts. Our paint is deeply layered and withstands all kinds of tests to scratch it or chip here at Naked Kitchens. Trust us, its hard. After all, on the nuclear subs, the stuff is probably actually bombproof. What’s more, we can spray in any colour, either from just the name, or from a colour-match sample, and we can offer the whole range of sheen options from total matt to full gloss.</p>
<p>Put simply, we don’t cut corners on painting our cabinets so you don’t chip them..</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Many of our customer’s come to us in search of ingenious storage solutions to make everyday use of their kitchens that little bit easier. Here are just a few units that our workshop have been busy constructing this week that make accessing those hard to reach nooks and crannies completely stress free.</p>
<div class="pivotx-wrapper"><img class="pivotx-image" title="corner caddy cabinet" src="https://www.nakedkitchens.com/blog/images/2015-08/corner-unit-1.jpg" alt="corner caddy cabinet" /></div>
<div class="pivotx-wrapper"></div>
<p><span id="more-21"></span></p>
<p>Corner caddies have a bit of a reputation for minimising the usable storage space inside your cabinets, however this chrome plated two-part pull out system banishes this theory. With a total of four baskets on two tiers, you really can make the most of every last centimetre your cabinet has to offer.</p>
<div class="pivotx-wrapper"><img class="pivotx-image" title="dual access corner cabinet" src="https://www.nakedkitchens.com/blog/images/2015-08/corner-unit-2.jpg" alt="dual access corner cabinet" /></div>

<p>As all of our cabinets are bespoke and made to order, we really can meet most design needs! See this dual access frameless cabinet requested by one of our clients. This unique coat and shoe store has been designed to sit seamlessly alongside the rest of this contemporary, modular kitchen, providing access points from both the kitchen on the left and the open plan living room to the right.</p>
<div class="pivotx-wrapper"><img class="pivotx-image" title="curved corner unit" src="https://www.nakedkitchens.com/blog/images/2015-08/curved-corner-cabinet.jpg" alt="curved corner unit" /></div>
<p>If you are looking for something a little more traditional, how about this beautifully curved in frame corner cabinet with oak framed shaker door? With face frames and plinths constructed from solid Appalachian White Oak, the materials used in our cabinets are unrivalled in quality and strength.</p>

<p><span id="more-30"></span></p>
<p>Unassembled cabinets are one of the easiest ways to save when buying your kitchen since you don’t have to pay to have your cabinets assembled. It is also a fantastic way of getting to know the material quality of the kitchen too. With a NAKED kitchen, our precision engineered components ensure your unassembled cabinets are a joy to put together and when assembled, last a lifetime. The great thing about a NAKED unassembled kitchen is that you receive the exact same high quality cabinets as you would with a complete kitchen as every single component is created in our state-of-the-art workshop. The difference is that you forgo assembly, fitting, and paint, so the cost is significantly lower.</p>

<p>We developed and tested our kitchens to be simple to assemble, whether put together by us or you. Therefore, assembling one of our bespoke kitchens is straight-forward, and although skill and effort is needed, if you are experienced at assembling furniture you should have no trouble at all. With a NAKED unassembled kitchen, you will receive a list of everything you need, mainly just simple tools. We will supply you with glue, screws and other materials needed so you can assemble the cabinets without fuss. If you have any queries, <a href="http://www.nakedkitchens.com/contact-us">drop us a line</a> as we are more than happy to help.</p>

<p>With the unassembled ‘Component’ option, there are shorter lead times as once you have confirmed your order, we take your design directly from screen to machine and once the components have passed quality control, they are then delivered straight to your door. With our streamlined production, you can receive your completely bespoke kitchen in just 4 weeks.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div class="pivotx-wrapper"><img class="pivotx-image" title="beaded kitchen cabinet frames" src="https://www.nakedkitchens.com/blog/images/2014-10/beaded-cabinet-frames.jpg" alt="beaded kitchen cabinet frames" /></div>
<p>These beaded cabinet frames, created out of our solid Appalachian Oak, are awaiting a final check before they are sent to the spray booth to be painted with our two-part paint system. Our paint offers sturdiness along with beautiful, deep colours from a limitless palette.</p>
<p><span id="more-38"></span></p>
<div class="pivotx-wrapper"><img class="pivotx-image" title="painting cabinet" src="https://www.nakedkitchens.com/blog/images/2014-10/painting-cabinet-by-hand.jpg" alt="painting cabinet" /></div>
<p>One of our painters applying a finishing touch around the beading of this elegantly curved solid Oak painted cabinet door. An incredibly skillful craft, beading adds a fine bespoke detail to your cabinets.</p>
<div class="pivotx-wrapper"><img class="pivotx-image" title="sanding component" src="https://www.nakedkitchens.com/blog/images/2014-10/sanding-component.jpg" alt="sanding component" /></div>
<p>Once the CNC machine has precisely cut the components, our joiners begin hand-finishing the cabinets by sanding the components until they are completely smooth.</p>
<div class="pivotx-wrapper"><img class="pivotx-image" title="fitting a drawer runner" src="https://www.nakedkitchens.com/blog/images/2014-10/fitting-drawer-runner.jpg" alt="fitting a drawer runner" /></div>
<p>Having been sanded, the cabinet components then receive the kitchen hardware during assembly. This carcass is being fitted with soft-close drawer runners from Grass. All of the hardware is fitted to millimetre tolerances, ensuring there are even gaps across the entire kitchen.</p>
<div class="pivotx-wrapper"><img class="pivotx-image" title="solid oak spice rack" src="https://www.nakedkitchens.com/blog/images/2014-10/solid-oak-spice-rack.jpg" alt="solid oak spice rack" /></div>
<p>This customer wanted a simply styled, classic design for their spice rack. With a natural finish, this spice rack compliments both traditional and modern kitchen interiors.</p>
<div class="pivotx-wrapper"><img class="pivotx-image" title="recessed walnut handle drawers" src="https://www.nakedkitchens.com/blog/images/2014-10/walnut-recessed-handle-cabinet.jpg" alt="recessed walnut handle drawers" /></div>
<p>The recessed handle drawer is a wonderfully minimalist design that shows off the beautiful wavy grain of our Black Walnut perfectly. This cabinet has been lacquered with our water and stain resistant treatment. Not only does it promote the natural deep colour of the sustainably-sourced timber, it ensures longevity too.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>At NAKED, delivering the ultimate kitchen is what we do. By steadily evolving our manufacturing processes, we have advanced our design, construction and material expertise to offer the most precisely engineered kitchen available.</p>
<p>Since moving to our 45,000 sq/ft hangar, we now have more than enough space to place state-of-the-art equipment within our workshop, the latest additions are two fantastic CNC machines containing the very latest CAD / CAM software.</p>
<div class="pivotx-wrapper"><img class="pivotx-image" title="new cnc at work" src="https://www.nakedkitchens.com/blog/images/2014-10/new-cnc-router.jpg" alt="new cnc at work" /></div>
<div class="pivotx-wrapper"></div>
<p><span id="more-39"></span></p>
<p>For those of you not familiar with the term, CNC stands for Computer Numerical Control and it is basically a computer controlled milling machine.</p>
<div class="pivotx-wrapper"><img class="pivotx-image" title="cnc in the hangar" src="https://www.nakedkitchens.com/blog/images/2014-10/new-cnc-in-workshop.jpg" alt="cnc in the hangar" /></div>
<p>The CNC machine allows our joiners to accurately convert the 3D CAD diagrams of your bespoke kitchen into an optimised numerical file before the machine cuts the cabinet components at high speed, all to millimetre preciseness. Quite the intelligent piece of kit.</p>
<div class="pivotx-wrapper"><img class="pivotx-image" title="custom CAD software" src="https://www.nakedkitchens.com/blog/images/2014-10/cnc-screen.jpg" alt="custom CAD software" /></div>
<p>Designed and built in Germany, and running the newest tailor-made software, our CNC machines provide a consistently high component production quality and increases our efficiency as well.</p>
<p>One of the innovative CNC machines has a 3-axis vertical spindle, allowing us a vast amount of creative design flexibility when manufacturing your made-to-measure cabinet components. The CNC machine features an automatic tool changer ensuring the perfect tool is used for the job instantly, while the machining head is fully equipped, containing a powerful drilling head that can drill on the vertical X and Y axis as well as horizontally drill and groove.</p>
<div class="pivotx-wrapper"><img class="pivotx-image" title="precision cnc router" src="https://www.nakedkitchens.com/blog/images/2014-10/new-cnc.jpg" alt="precision cnc router" /></div>
<p>The other CNC machine offers us intricate precision milling capabilities such as engraving, and can machine a component on all four sides during one operation, shortening lead times whilst maintaining optimum precision and machining quality. With fifteen drilling spindles. Six horizontal drills and an integrated sawing unit, this CNC machine provides the flexibility and accuracy we need to ensure your kitchen is made to exact measurements.</p>
<div class="pivotx-wrapper"><img class="pivotx-image" title="unwrapping the vertical cnc" src="https://www.nakedkitchens.com/blog/images/2014-10/unwrapping-new-vertical-cnc.jpg" alt="unwrapping the vertical cnc" /></div>
<p>What this all means for us is further optimisation of our production, resulting in less wastage and higher accuracy on every single component, eliminating issues that can be later found during fitting.</p>
<div class="pivotx-wrapper"><img class="pivotx-image" title="new vertical cnc" src="https://www.nakedkitchens.com/blog/images/2014-10/new-vertical-cnc2_1.jpg" alt="new vertical cnc" /></div>
<p>For you this means you receive a kitchen that is more creative in its design, more unique in its style, and more special in how it feels.</p>
<div class="pivotx-wrapper"><img class="pivotx-image" title="bespoke kitchen" src="https://www.nakedkitchens.com/blog/images/2014-10/anmer-blog.jpg" alt="bespoke kitchen" /></div>

<p>This naked frame cabinet is about to recieve some final touches before under-going a pre-delivery check. The colour on this cabinet has been specially mixed to ensure the grain of the solid Oak doors is prominant.</p>
<div class="pivotx-wrapper"><img class="pivotx-image" title="oak cabinet construction" src="https://www.nakedkitchens.com/blog/images/2014-09/img_9385-edit.jpg" alt="oak cabinet construction" /></div>
<p>One of our joiners assembling a Oak veneered Birch ply cabinet, all the customer needs to do is paint it once it&#8217;s delivered.</p>
<div class="pivotx-wrapper"><img class="pivotx-image" title="appliance cabinet front" src="https://www.nakedkitchens.com/blog/images/2014-09/img_9797-edit.jpg" alt="appliance cabinet front" /></div>
<p>Not wanting to break the run of cabinets up with an appliance, this customer has requested a bespoke dishwasher front crafted from solid Oak and styled as a drawer and door cabinet.</p>
<div class="pivotx-wrapper"><img class="pivotx-image" title="naked frame kitchen" src="https://www.nakedkitchens.com/blog/images/2014-09/showroom-44-edit.jpg" alt="naked frame kitchen" /></div>
