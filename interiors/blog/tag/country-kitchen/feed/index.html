				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>With our round up of 2017 post, we let you know all of the trends we were loving for the kitchen in 2017, and so we thought it was only right that we share our prediction of kitchen trends for 2018. With January now over, there have been some clear paths set, making it much easier to see which trends are emerging, and which ones look set to stay!</p>
<p><strong>METALS<br />
</strong>The use of metal in the kitchen is something that we saw more and more of towards the end of 2017, but 2018 is set to see metals used in much more of a statement way. With beautiful darker colours being used in kitchens, brighter metals are being used alongside to provide beautiful accents throughout the room. Traditional metals such as gold and silver will always have a place in kitchen designs, but bolder metals like brass and copper are really pushing their way through. Copper in particular- a metal generally only seen in the kitchen in the form of saucepans- is being used to create incredible accessories, such as faucets and sinks, with a beautiful patina forming over time.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone wp-image-850 size-large" src="https://www.nakedkitchens.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/sites/8/2018/01/mood-board-4-1024x683.jpg" alt="" width="640" height="427" srcset="https://www.nakedkitchens.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/sites/8/2018/01/mood-board-4-1024x683.jpg 1024w, https://www.nakedkitchens.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/sites/8/2018/01/mood-board-4-300x200.jpg 300w, https://www.nakedkitchens.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/sites/8/2018/01/mood-board-4-768x512.jpg 768w, https://www.nakedkitchens.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/sites/8/2018/01/mood-board-4.jpg 1500w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" /></p>
<p><span id="more-822"></span></p>
<p>The use of metal splashbacks is something we&#8217;re also looking forward to seeing more of within kitchen designs. Instantly catching the eye when you enter the room, the splashback is a beautiful feature. We particularly love when different finishes are applied to the metal, as beautiful individual markings are left on the feature.</p>
<p><strong>STATEMENT FLOORING<br />
</strong>Statement Flooring is a feature that we&#8217;re sure we&#8217;re going to see everywhere in 2018. Flooring is something that has always been on our radar when designing a kitchen, as obviously it can completely change the way a kitchen looks in an instant. We can&#8217;t deny that we have always loved seeing a beautiful wooden floor in a kitchen, in particular using<strong> </strong>limed oak floor to add a beautiful, subtle modern feel to a room.<br />
The Redhill Kitchen design we completed last year, contains an incredible statement floor that was actually a reclaimed gym floor, creating an eye catching feature from an element of a room that usually goes relatively unnoticed. We&#8217;re looking forward to seeing more unique flooring choices, including brighter and much darker floors.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone wp-image-695 size-large" src="https://www.nakedkitchens.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/sites/8/2017/11/Redhill-30-1024x683.jpg" alt="" width="640" height="427" srcset="https://www.nakedkitchens.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/sites/8/2017/11/Redhill-30-1024x683.jpg 1024w, https://www.nakedkitchens.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/sites/8/2017/11/Redhill-30-300x200.jpg 300w, https://www.nakedkitchens.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/sites/8/2017/11/Redhill-30-768x512.jpg 768w, https://www.nakedkitchens.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/sites/8/2017/11/Redhill-30.jpg 1500w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" /><em>Photography- NK Living</em></p>
<p><strong>DARKER COLOURED KITCHENS<br />
</strong>We will always love a white kitchen. They&#8217;re incredibly fresh, and make a room feel light and open, and will be a colour that many people will continue to choose for years to come. However, there is a new colour trend on the horizon, with many people&#8217;s attention turning to the much darker colours of the spectrum, such as Forest Green, Navy and Black.<br />
These types of colours are captivating and make a room incredibly rich and intense. These are not necessarily colours that will work in everyone&#8217;s space, but so far all of the kitchens that we&#8217;ve seen take this risk, it has definitely paid off for them! We&#8217;re also seeing a lot more walls and cabinetry painted in the same colour, which is a very intense and brave choice but gives a beautiful, rich warmth to the room.<br />
We also think that including bright metal accessories within the design of these dark rooms looks incredible, really bouncing and brightening the room against such a dark backdrop. Using a brighter worktop material such as a metal or timber will create a break between the walls and the cabinetry, ensuring the room doesn&#8217;t feel closed off and that there is still an element of brightness to the room.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone wp-image-208 size-large" src="https://www.nakedkitchens.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/sites/8/2016/10/ladbrooke-2-683x1024.jpg" alt="" width="640" height="960" srcset="https://www.nakedkitchens.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/sites/8/2016/10/ladbrooke-2-683x1024.jpg 683w, https://www.nakedkitchens.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/sites/8/2016/10/ladbrooke-2-200x300.jpg 200w, https://www.nakedkitchens.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/sites/8/2016/10/ladbrooke-2-768x1152.jpg 768w, https://www.nakedkitchens.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/sites/8/2016/10/ladbrooke-2.jpg 1000w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" /></p>
<p><strong>PERSONAL TOUCH<br />
</strong>Personalisation of your room will be a big feature in 2018. With many people opting for open shelving and open cabinets, this is a really easy way to add a personal touch to the room by displaying all of  your favourite items.<br />
One design we have seen that really allowed this was the beautiful oak dressing room we created for the Hertfordshire Manor House recently. A statement making room, that is completely open, with only the set back drawers for hidden storage, meaning all of the clients belongings were on show, really allowing their personality to shine through!</p>
<p><img class="alignnone wp-image-871 size-large" src="https://www.nakedkitchens.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/sites/8/2018/01/Claytons-10-1024x683.jpg" alt="" width="640" height="427" srcset="https://www.nakedkitchens.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/sites/8/2018/01/Claytons-10-1024x683.jpg 1024w, https://www.nakedkitchens.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/sites/8/2018/01/Claytons-10-300x200.jpg 300w, https://www.nakedkitchens.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/sites/8/2018/01/Claytons-10-768x512.jpg 768w, https://www.nakedkitchens.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/sites/8/2018/01/Claytons-10.jpg 1500w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" /></p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>We&#8217;ve been busy here at Naked Kitchens getting to grips with the new trends and looks that are set to be popular in 2018. With the announcement of Dulux&#8217;s colour of 2018 Heartwood and Pantone releasing Ultra Violet as their chosen colour, it&#8217;s clear that purple will be involved within interiors this year. One of our creative kitchen designers created this mood board based around their favourite looks and much of the inspiration comes from what we&#8217;ve been designing with clients!</p>
<p><img class="alignnone wp-image-849 size-large" src="https://www.nakedkitchens.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/sites/8/2018/01/mood-board-3-1024x683.jpg" alt="" width="640" height="427" srcset="https://www.nakedkitchens.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/sites/8/2018/01/mood-board-3-1024x683.jpg 1024w, https://www.nakedkitchens.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/sites/8/2018/01/mood-board-3-300x200.jpg 300w, https://www.nakedkitchens.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/sites/8/2018/01/mood-board-3-768x512.jpg 768w, https://www.nakedkitchens.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/sites/8/2018/01/mood-board-3.jpg 1500w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" /></p>
<p><span id="more-847"></span></p>
<p>The use of heart wood as a colour is something that we&#8217;re absolutely loving seeing in kitchens at the moment. The beautiful pink tones in this colour work incredibly well with the oak and the marble within this combination and create a timeless colour palette.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone wp-image-848 size-large" src="https://www.nakedkitchens.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/sites/8/2018/01/mood-board-1-683x1024.jpg" alt="" width="640" height="960" srcset="https://www.nakedkitchens.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/sites/8/2018/01/mood-board-1-683x1024.jpg 683w, https://www.nakedkitchens.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/sites/8/2018/01/mood-board-1-200x300.jpg 200w, https://www.nakedkitchens.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/sites/8/2018/01/mood-board-1-768x1152.jpg 768w, https://www.nakedkitchens.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/sites/8/2018/01/mood-board-1.jpg 1000w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" /></p>
<p>By using darker accent colours it means that there is an additional depth to this design that gives a beautiful richness despite the natural feel of the collection. By using oak as the main timber choice it means that everything feels incredibly natural, and the whitewash finish ensures that the contemporary vibe isn&#8217;t lost and that everything is in-keeping with the cooler tones of the colours.</p>
<p>Despite the investment in colour in kitchens recently, we will always love grey in a kitchen, and we think it looks especially timeless and beautiful in a traditional shaker kitchen design. Recently we&#8217;ve seen examples of kitchens finished in a matte grey, and we think this is a beautiful way to have an updated version of a timeless neutral in your kitchen, and this works beautifully in a more contemporary, slab door style.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone wp-image-850 size-large" src="https://www.nakedkitchens.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/sites/8/2018/01/mood-board-4-1024x683.jpg" alt="" width="640" height="427" srcset="https://www.nakedkitchens.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/sites/8/2018/01/mood-board-4-1024x683.jpg 1024w, https://www.nakedkitchens.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/sites/8/2018/01/mood-board-4-300x200.jpg 300w, https://www.nakedkitchens.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/sites/8/2018/01/mood-board-4-768x512.jpg 768w, https://www.nakedkitchens.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/sites/8/2018/01/mood-board-4.jpg 1500w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" /></p>
<p>Using metals within your kitchen is still set to be very big 2018. With clients opting for brighter metals as a big feature in their kitchen such as copper and brass, there is no slowing down of the metallic trend this year. We are loving the use of copper within this design, as we think it really pops next to the white washed oak and the colours used, due to the bright, rose undertones.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone wp-image-851 size-large" src="https://www.nakedkitchens.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/sites/8/2018/01/mood-board-6-1024x683.jpg" alt="" width="640" height="427" srcset="https://www.nakedkitchens.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/sites/8/2018/01/mood-board-6-1024x683.jpg 1024w, https://www.nakedkitchens.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/sites/8/2018/01/mood-board-6-300x200.jpg 300w, https://www.nakedkitchens.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/sites/8/2018/01/mood-board-6-768x512.jpg 768w, https://www.nakedkitchens.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/sites/8/2018/01/mood-board-6.jpg 1500w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" /></p>
<p>Within this design the use of white accessories and marble helps to keep it clean a bright. Oak is generally a timber that can look quite warm and traditional, so by keeping everything else light and bright it ensures that this design will never look dated. White within a kitchen is never going to be out of fashion, so it is always a brilliant colour to bring into a design to keep it looking fresh.</p>
<p>We hope you enjoyed seeing what we&#8217;re loving in kitchens at the moment, and that it gave you some inspiration for your future kitchen!

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>What is a Bespoke Kitchen?<br />
</strong>Re-designing a space can be difficult enough without having the added worry of cost, function, and depreciation. But unlike picking the wrong colour sofa cushions or curtains that clash with the wallpaper, a kitchen is a little harder to change once you&#8217;ve committed!<br />
Purchasing a new kitchen for your home is a very big decision, and nobody wants to be left with a kitchen they don&#8217;t truly love every part of. At Naked Kitchens this won&#8217;t happen, as we will always go the extra step to ensure you love every single detail of your design before the material has even been cut!<br />
A bespoke kitchen is one that is entirely unique to each and every client. There is no standard sizing, and whilst we have kitchen designs that can be followed for inspiration, we can create completely unique designs for every customer. We use the finest natural resources to produce beautiful, sturdy and timeless kitchen cabinetry. With the choice of any fascia colour or exposed natural timber to complement all tastes, we guarantee pure kitchen love.</p>
<p style="text-align: left"><img class="alignnone wp-image-652 size-large" src="https://www.nakedkitchens.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/sites/8/2017/10/raynham-5-683x1024.jpg" alt="" width="640" height="960" srcset="https://www.nakedkitchens.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/sites/8/2017/10/raynham-5-683x1024.jpg 683w, https://www.nakedkitchens.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/sites/8/2017/10/raynham-5-200x300.jpg 200w, https://www.nakedkitchens.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/sites/8/2017/10/raynham-5-768x1152.jpg 768w, https://www.nakedkitchens.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/sites/8/2017/10/raynham-5.jpg 1000w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" /></p>
<p><span id="more-656"></span></p>
<p><strong>But what does it really mean to have a bespoke kitchen?</strong></p>
<p>Contrary to some opinions, a truly bespoke kitchen is 100% tailor-made and designed for the client. Whilst some kitchen companies claim to be fully bespoke, the reality is that they simply offer different pre-determined options and limit the customers to standard sizes. Unlike these manufacturers, Naked Kitchens offer a fully bespoke service. Whilst other kitchen manufacturers stockpile kitchen cabinets in standard sizes, we will not even cut our materials until your tailor-made kitchen design is exactly as you want it. This not only ensures a reduction in waste material but it also means you get your dream kitchen that is the perfect size!</p>
<p><img class="alignnone wp-image-208 size-large" src="https://www.nakedkitchens.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/sites/8/2016/10/ladbrooke-2-683x1024.jpg" alt="" width="640" height="960" srcset="https://www.nakedkitchens.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/sites/8/2016/10/ladbrooke-2-683x1024.jpg 683w, https://www.nakedkitchens.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/sites/8/2016/10/ladbrooke-2-200x300.jpg 200w, https://www.nakedkitchens.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/sites/8/2016/10/ladbrooke-2-768x1152.jpg 768w, https://www.nakedkitchens.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/sites/8/2016/10/ladbrooke-2.jpg 1000w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" /></p>
<p><strong>So how do we create a truly bespoke kitchen?</strong></p>
<p>We offer a design service for our clients, as we like to get to know our customers tastes and preferences, as well as asking for a room plan for the space so that we know the dimensions we are working with. From creating custom built beautiful larders to developing clever storage solutions to hide bulky appliances, everything we create is truly bespoke. With the technology that we have invested in we are able to take the design we have created on the screen, straight to our cutting machines. This means that we can get the bespoke kitchen to you much quicker, whilst creating minimal waste too.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone wp-image-379 size-large" src="https://www.nakedkitchens.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/sites/8/2017/08/Raynham-Larder-683x1024.jpg" alt="" width="640" height="960" srcset="https://www.nakedkitchens.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/sites/8/2017/08/Raynham-Larder-683x1024.jpg 683w, https://www.nakedkitchens.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/sites/8/2017/08/Raynham-Larder-200x300.jpg 200w, https://www.nakedkitchens.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/sites/8/2017/08/Raynham-Larder-768x1152.jpg 768w, https://www.nakedkitchens.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/sites/8/2017/08/Raynham-Larder.jpg 1000w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" /></p>
<p>To us, working with just standard cabinet size or configurations will completely limit all creativity when designing a kitchen. Creating a standard kitchen is just not in our nature. Whilst some elements of a kitchen will always remain the same, such as the need for a sink and cooker, we will never limit you on having typical 600 x 800 cabinets throughout, nor will we restrict you on the formation within, with many bespoke internal features available.<br />

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>2017 has definitely been the year for changing trends in kitchens. We&#8217;ve seen some incredibly beautiful trends throughout the year, but also a few that we&#8217;re happy to see never return!</p>
<p>Whilst we like to see all of the different interior trends throughout the year, we never create kitchens just to go along with those trends. We like to create kitchens that will stand the test of time and would never be considered a fad, so despite some of our kitchens being incredibly modern, they will never be out of fashion as they have so many timeless features within their designs. We have incorporated some trends into the designs we have created this year as we know they will last, but there are a few that we knew would be very short-lived. This post is simply a round up of our favourite trends from the past year, and we hope you enjoy re-living it with us!</p>
<p><img class="alignnone wp-image-456 size-large" src="https://www.nakedkitchens.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/sites/8/2017/08/brancaster-marshes-6-1024x683.jpg" alt="" width="640" height="427" srcset="https://www.nakedkitchens.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/sites/8/2017/08/brancaster-marshes-6-1024x683.jpg 1024w, https://www.nakedkitchens.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/sites/8/2017/08/brancaster-marshes-6-300x200.jpg 300w, https://www.nakedkitchens.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/sites/8/2017/08/brancaster-marshes-6-768x512.jpg 768w, https://www.nakedkitchens.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/sites/8/2017/08/brancaster-marshes-6.jpg 1500w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" /></p>
<p><span id="more-789"></span></p>
<p>One of the main trends of 2017 that we were fully supportive of is the mixing of materials within the kitchen. The kitchens we create for our clients are often finished in neutral colours, and therefore we like to try and incorporate another material into the design to ensure there is enough texture and warmth within the room.<br />
Mixing materials creates so many new textures for the eye to focus on, and ensures that the kitchen never feels flat or boring. As a company that specialises in using timber, we love to try and incorporate some form of exposed wood into the design. We particularly love the look of whitewashed oak in a neutral painted kitchen, as it brings a beautiful contemporary vibe to a neutral kitchen, without looking too cold or modern. Walnut is also a beautiful option for bringing warmth and sophistication to a kitchen, and mixes beautifully with a rich, intense colour palette.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone wp-image-208 size-large" src="https://www.nakedkitchens.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/sites/8/2016/10/ladbrooke-2-683x1024.jpg" alt="" width="640" height="960" srcset="https://www.nakedkitchens.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/sites/8/2016/10/ladbrooke-2-683x1024.jpg 683w, https://www.nakedkitchens.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/sites/8/2016/10/ladbrooke-2-200x300.jpg 200w, https://www.nakedkitchens.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/sites/8/2016/10/ladbrooke-2-768x1152.jpg 768w, https://www.nakedkitchens.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/sites/8/2016/10/ladbrooke-2.jpg 1000w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" /></p>
<p>Industrial style kitchens were also very popular in 2017, and this is actually set to continue into 2018 too. With the Scandi inspired trend of minimalism in a kitchen design, this has led to a lot of customers wanting to incorporate metal into their kitchen design, giving the kitchen an industrial vibe. We love the use of thin, black metal, as we think it contrasts beautifully with an exposed timber or painted kitchen. But, another trend that we have really got on board with is the use of warm metals in the kitchen. This can be done in a very subtle way, with handles or simple accessories, but we particularly love when metal is incorporated in a really bold way in the kitchen such as a splashback. One of our favourite (and our customers favourite) kitchen designs is our Ladbroke Kitchen, which has a large antiqued brass splashback, and is just absolutely stunning!</p>
<p><img class="alignnone wp-image-563 size-large" src="https://www.nakedkitchens.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/sites/8/2017/09/cley-2-683x1024.jpg" alt="" width="640" height="960" srcset="https://www.nakedkitchens.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/sites/8/2017/09/cley-2-683x1024.jpg 683w, https://www.nakedkitchens.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/sites/8/2017/09/cley-2-200x300.jpg 200w, https://www.nakedkitchens.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/sites/8/2017/09/cley-2-768x1152.jpg 768w, https://www.nakedkitchens.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/sites/8/2017/09/cley-2.jpg 1000w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" /></p>
<p>One trend we do love to see in kitchens is open shelving. Whilst wall cabinetry is absolutely beautiful, a lot of the kitchens we have designed recently are much more compact, we have to ensure we incorporate certain design features to keep the room as light as possible. By using open shelving instead of wall cabinets, it means that the customer can still have storage within their compact room, but it never closes the room off. These open shelves also allow the client to put their own personal twist on their kitchen, as they can use these shelves to display their favourite items showing their visitors what they love.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone wp-image-207 size-large" src="https://www.nakedkitchens.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/sites/8/2016/10/ladbrooke-71-1024x683.jpg" alt="" width="640" height="427" srcset="https://www.nakedkitchens.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/sites/8/2016/10/ladbrooke-71-1024x683.jpg 1024w, https://www.nakedkitchens.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/sites/8/2016/10/ladbrooke-71-300x200.jpg 300w, https://www.nakedkitchens.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/sites/8/2016/10/ladbrooke-71-768x512.jpg 768w, https://www.nakedkitchens.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/sites/8/2016/10/ladbrooke-71.jpg 1500w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" /></p>
<p>Another favourite of 2017 kitchen trends was the use of a rich colour palette for cabinetry and walls. With many people choosing to break away from the normal neutrals that we see in so many kitchens, they were looking for alternatives that make an intense statement, but still look natural and not overwhelming in any way. We particularly love the look of dark greens and blues in a kitchen, but we&#8217;re sure there are many colours we&#8217;re going to see in 2018 that will make an incredible statement in the same way.<br />
We love when this colour palette is styled with some form of exposed timber, as we think these materials really compliment the rich colours and create an incredible relaxing vibe in the room.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone wp-image-564 size-large" src="https://www.nakedkitchens.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/sites/8/2017/09/cley-1-1024x683.jpg" alt="" width="640" height="427" srcset="https://www.nakedkitchens.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/sites/8/2017/09/cley-1-1024x683.jpg 1024w, https://www.nakedkitchens.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/sites/8/2017/09/cley-1-300x200.jpg 300w, https://www.nakedkitchens.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/sites/8/2017/09/cley-1-768x512.jpg 768w, https://www.nakedkitchens.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/sites/8/2017/09/cley-1.jpg 1500w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" /></p>
<p>Open plan living is something we saw many people try to incorporate into their kitchen design in 2017. With people looking to try and combine living, dining and cooking, and the kitchen becoming a very sociable gathering point for the whole family in the house, many clients are looking to make their kitchen into an area that incorporates all three.<br />
We use elements that we know can help to create a room of this style, such as large central island with seating for dining and socialising, or unique storage features such as bi-folding doors to hide TV&#8217;s to please all members of the family.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone wp-image-477 size-large" src="https://www.nakedkitchens.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/sites/8/2017/08/1-683x1024.jpg" alt="" width="640" height="960" srcset="https://www.nakedkitchens.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/sites/8/2017/08/1-683x1024.jpg 683w, https://www.nakedkitchens.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/sites/8/2017/08/1-200x300.jpg 200w, https://www.nakedkitchens.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/sites/8/2017/08/1-768x1152.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" /></p>
<p>Handle-less kitchen cabinetry is also a trend we&#8217;ve seen and wholly embraced in 2017. With many clients opting for a more contemporary kitchen for their modern home, a more sleek look has been embraced and handle-less cabinetry has been chosen. Whether this is the circular cut out detail like our Ladbroke Kitchen or the J-Groove handle on our Portobello Kitchen design, this handle-less detail ensures that the kitchen keeps its clean lines and contemporary feel.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone wp-image-379 size-large" src="https://www.nakedkitchens.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/sites/8/2017/08/Raynham-Larder-683x1024.jpg" alt="" width="640" height="960" srcset="https://www.nakedkitchens.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/sites/8/2017/08/Raynham-Larder-683x1024.jpg 683w, https://www.nakedkitchens.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/sites/8/2017/08/Raynham-Larder-200x300.jpg 200w, https://www.nakedkitchens.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/sites/8/2017/08/Raynham-Larder-768x1152.jpg 768w, https://www.nakedkitchens.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/sites/8/2017/08/Raynham-Larder.jpg 1000w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" /></p>
<p>Despite this not being a very exciting trend for 2017, the increase in people wanting to put bespoke storage solutions into their kitchens has been immense. With the popularity of larders and storage solutions that are completely bespoke to the customer such as engraved drawers, specially designed spice racks, and pull out caddies, there is no doubt that we have created pieces that perfectly fit with our customers lives. We&#8217;re not the only people who have noticed this trend however, with Houzz even writing an <a href="https://www.houzz.co.uk/ideabooks/97841939/list/is-this-the-most-desirable-kitchen-feature-right-now">article </a>on larders being the most desirable kitchen feature of the moment!</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>As with most companies, the lead up to Christmas is one of the busiest times of the year for us. We always try to ensure that our customers get their kitchens before Christmas, so that they can enjoy this festive period of the year in their new kitchen.</p>
<p>At this time of the year, we love to see how our customers have dressed their kitchens for Christmas as we always think a kitchen looks even more special with some festive decorations! So we asked our customers who have purchased a Naked Kitchen this year, to send us in a few snaps of their room at Christmas so we can share with you our beautiful kitchen designs with a festive twist!</p>
<p><img class="alignnone wp-image-801 size-large" src="https://www.nakedkitchens.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/sites/8/2017/12/old-forge-kitchen-1-1024x683.jpg" alt="" width="640" height="427" srcset="https://www.nakedkitchens.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/sites/8/2017/12/old-forge-kitchen-1-1024x683.jpg 1024w, https://www.nakedkitchens.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/sites/8/2017/12/old-forge-kitchen-1-300x200.jpg 300w, https://www.nakedkitchens.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/sites/8/2017/12/old-forge-kitchen-1-768x512.jpg 768w, https://www.nakedkitchens.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/sites/8/2017/12/old-forge-kitchen-1.jpg 1500w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" /></p>
<p><span id="more-736"></span></p>
<p><img class="alignnone wp-image-802 size-large" src="https://www.nakedkitchens.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/sites/8/2017/12/old-forge-kitchen-6-1024x683.jpg" alt="" width="640" height="427" srcset="https://www.nakedkitchens.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/sites/8/2017/12/old-forge-kitchen-6-1024x683.jpg 1024w, https://www.nakedkitchens.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/sites/8/2017/12/old-forge-kitchen-6-300x200.jpg 300w, https://www.nakedkitchens.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/sites/8/2017/12/old-forge-kitchen-6-768x512.jpg 768w, https://www.nakedkitchens.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/sites/8/2017/12/old-forge-kitchen-6.jpg 1500w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" /></p>
<p>The Old Forge Kitchen is one of our favourite kitchen designs, as it is so beautifully simple and traditional. The perfect country kitchen, with Shaker cabinets, Oak worktops and a bold painted island, there is no doubt that the beauty of this classic kitchen shines through. Dressed up with some simple festive decorations, this room is elegance epitomised.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone wp-image-812 size-large" src="https://www.nakedkitchens.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/sites/8/2017/12/kitchen-2-1024x768.jpg" alt="" width="640" height="480" srcset="https://www.nakedkitchens.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/sites/8/2017/12/kitchen-2-1024x768.jpg 1024w, https://www.nakedkitchens.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/sites/8/2017/12/kitchen-2-300x225.jpg 300w, https://www.nakedkitchens.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/sites/8/2017/12/kitchen-2-768x576.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" /></p>
<p><img class="alignnone wp-image-813 size-large" src="https://www.nakedkitchens.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/sites/8/2017/12/kitchen-5-1024x680.jpg" alt="" width="640" height="425" srcset="https://www.nakedkitchens.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/sites/8/2017/12/kitchen-5-1024x680.jpg 1024w, https://www.nakedkitchens.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/sites/8/2017/12/kitchen-5-300x199.jpg 300w, https://www.nakedkitchens.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/sites/8/2017/12/kitchen-5-768x510.jpg 768w, https://www.nakedkitchens.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/sites/8/2017/12/kitchen-5.jpg 1549w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" /></p>
<p>The Meadow Kitchen shows how traditional Shaker style can still be used to create a beautiful, contemporary kitchen. Like the Old Forge Kitchen shown above, this room is<strong> </strong>decorated in such a simple and elegant way, allowing the kitchen&#8217;s true beauty to shine through and create a festive wonderland without ever looking over the top.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>At Christmas, the kitchen is probably the room that will get the most use in the house. With the extra visits from family and friends at this time of the year, there is so much more socialising, drinking, eating and just general use of the kitchen.<br />
Whether its unexpected guests popping in for a quick drink and nibbles or a planned dinner party with lots of guests and a three course meal, your kitchen is going to need to be ready to face the battles of festive socialising. So to help you, we&#8217;ve created a list to help you get your kitchen match fit for this busy season!</p>
<p><img class="alignnone wp-image-690 size-large" src="https://www.nakedkitchens.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/sites/8/2017/11/MG_4834-Edit-1024x683.jpg" alt="" width="640" height="427" srcset="https://www.nakedkitchens.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/sites/8/2017/11/MG_4834-Edit-1024x683.jpg 1024w, https://www.nakedkitchens.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/sites/8/2017/11/MG_4834-Edit-300x200.jpg 300w, https://www.nakedkitchens.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/sites/8/2017/11/MG_4834-Edit-768x512.jpg 768w, https://www.nakedkitchens.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/sites/8/2017/11/MG_4834-Edit.jpg 1500w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" /><br />
<span style="text-decoration: underline"><em>Architecture- NK Living, Photography- Chris Snook</em></span></p>
<p><span id="more-746"></span></p>
<p><strong>De-Clutter<br />
</strong>Despite this being an activity that is generally completed after Christmas as a New Year activity, we actually find it more useful to de-clutter and &#8216;spring&#8217; clean before the festivities begin, so you can start this busy festive period with a fresh, clean environment.<br />
With cupboards slowly getting fuller throughout the year with newer items, it&#8217;s likely you haven&#8217;t had the chance to organise your cupboards and cabinets, and there are certain items stuck at the back of the cupboard that you specifically need at this time of the year. By organising these cupboards, you will be able to see exactly what you do have, rearrange their position in the cabinet, and equally tick items off your Christmas list that you&#8217;ve realised you already own! By having bespoke storage solutions in your cabinets, including spice racks, pull out caddies, baskets and custom-sized drawers means that you can keep your kitchen organised all year round and never have to worry about your cupboards being untidy.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone wp-image-379 size-large" src="https://www.nakedkitchens.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/sites/8/2017/08/Raynham-Larder-683x1024.jpg" alt="" width="640" height="960" srcset="https://www.nakedkitchens.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/sites/8/2017/08/Raynham-Larder-683x1024.jpg 683w, https://www.nakedkitchens.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/sites/8/2017/08/Raynham-Larder-200x300.jpg 200w, https://www.nakedkitchens.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/sites/8/2017/08/Raynham-Larder-768x1152.jpg 768w, https://www.nakedkitchens.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/sites/8/2017/08/Raynham-Larder.jpg 1000w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" /><br />
Alongside organising the inside of cupboards, we would also recommend ensuring that the rest of your room is as clear of clutter as possible. This may involve removing certain utensils or accessories from your work surface and demoting them to a nearby cupboard for the rest of the festive period! This will ensure your room doesn&#8217;t look overcrowded- especially if you&#8217;ve decorated the room for Christmas- and will ensure that friends and family have room to place their drinks and food when they&#8217;re visiting.</p>
<p><strong>Welcoming Atmosphere</strong></p>
<p>After de-cluttering, you may start to feel as though your kitchen is looking a little bare, and whilst clean and clear to host and socialise in with friends and family, there are a few things missing. We would recommend introducing a few welcoming accessories to ensure your room still feels ready for visitors!<br />
Bringing in new textures is a beautiful way to make a room welcoming, and whilst many may think of this as just being textiles like cushions and throws- it really doesn&#8217;t just stop there. Textures can be in the form of flooring, tiles, metallic accessories and so many other things. One kitchen that we have seen do this is the Highbury Kitchen, which has so many different materials and incorporates the Scandi trend so beautifully.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone wp-image-767 size-large" src="https://www.nakedkitchens.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/sites/8/2017/12/kia-designs-9-1024x666.jpg" alt="" width="640" height="416" srcset="https://www.nakedkitchens.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/sites/8/2017/12/kia-designs-9-1024x666.jpg 1024w, https://www.nakedkitchens.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/sites/8/2017/12/kia-designs-9-300x195.jpg 300w, https://www.nakedkitchens.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/sites/8/2017/12/kia-designs-9-768x500.jpg 768w, https://www.nakedkitchens.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/sites/8/2017/12/kia-designs-9.jpg 1500w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" /><br />

<p>Our Ladbroke Kitchen is another kitchen that uses so many textures and is so welcoming because of it. Despite its dark colouring, this kitchen is incredibly rich almost engulfing you in a sense of warmth when you enter the room, with bright metallic accessories helping to keep the room bright and open.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone wp-image-207 size-large" src="https://www.nakedkitchens.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/sites/8/2016/10/ladbrooke-71-1024x683.jpg" alt="" width="640" height="427" srcset="https://www.nakedkitchens.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/sites/8/2016/10/ladbrooke-71-1024x683.jpg 1024w, https://www.nakedkitchens.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/sites/8/2016/10/ladbrooke-71-300x200.jpg 300w, https://www.nakedkitchens.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/sites/8/2016/10/ladbrooke-71-768x512.jpg 768w, https://www.nakedkitchens.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/sites/8/2016/10/ladbrooke-71.jpg 1500w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" /></p>
<p><strong>Seating<br />
</strong>At Christmas time especially, it is important that you have enough dining area in your home. Whatever the size of your kitchen, there is always a way to incorporate some form of dining area into your room, whether this is a seating arrangement at your island, or an actual dining table. Christmas is all about spending time with your loved ones, and there is nothing better than sitting down together to eat a dinner and talk to each other! We think that these kitchen designs with stools tucked up under the island are the perfect solution, and create a beautifully informal dining area that is perfect for just quickly serving up a meal to hungry children or for gathering with friends for a quick drink.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone wp-image-568 size-large" src="https://www.nakedkitchens.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/sites/8/2017/10/norfolk-vicarage-1-1024x683.jpg" alt="" width="640" height="427" srcset="https://www.nakedkitchens.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/sites/8/2017/10/norfolk-vicarage-1-1024x683.jpg 1024w, https://www.nakedkitchens.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/sites/8/2017/10/norfolk-vicarage-1-300x200.jpg 300w, https://www.nakedkitchens.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/sites/8/2017/10/norfolk-vicarage-1-768x512.jpg 768w, https://www.nakedkitchens.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/sites/8/2017/10/norfolk-vicarage-1.jpg 1500w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" /></p>
<p>If you do have a large kitchen however, a dining table is an absolutely beautiful addition, and will completely change dinner times in your household. Not just in the festive period, but all year round, sitting down at the table to eat dinner with your family, and catch up on each others lives will really help you to reflect and relax more in your home. Norfolk Oak have created some absolutely beautiful dining tables for clients, including the beautiful table below, for the Cley Kitchen.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone wp-image-552 size-large" src="https://www.nakedkitchens.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/sites/8/2017/09/cley-13-683x1024.jpg" alt="" width="640" height="960" srcset="https://www.nakedkitchens.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/sites/8/2017/09/cley-13-683x1024.jpg 683w, https://www.nakedkitchens.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/sites/8/2017/09/cley-13-200x300.jpg 200w, https://www.nakedkitchens.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/sites/8/2017/09/cley-13-768x1152.jpg 768w, https://www.nakedkitchens.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/sites/8/2017/09/cley-13.jpg 1000w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" /></p>
<p><strong>Out With The Old, In With The New<br />
</strong>Whilst Christmas is one of the most happy and fun times of the year, it can also bring with it many different problems. The main one of these being something going wrong. I&#8217;m sure many of you can remember at some point in your lifetime an oven breaking on Christmas day or a dishwasher going wrong and having to laboriously hand wash every piece of cutlery and crockery you&#8217;ve used. Both of these problems are definitely not the end of the world, but they can make what can be quite stressful task even more difficult. If you know that your dishwasher or oven or any other crucial appliance are temperamental or are definitely likely to break any time soon, we would recommend replacing these before Christmas. As a Miele Premier Partner, we would always recommend purchasing these appliances, simply due to their incredible quality and style.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone wp-image-768 size-large" src="https://www.nakedkitchens.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/sites/8/2017/12/glass-house-19-1024x683.jpg" alt="" width="640" height="427" srcset="https://www.nakedkitchens.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/sites/8/2017/12/glass-house-19-1024x683.jpg 1024w, https://www.nakedkitchens.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/sites/8/2017/12/glass-house-19-300x200.jpg 300w, https://www.nakedkitchens.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/sites/8/2017/12/glass-house-19-768x513.jpg 768w, https://www.nakedkitchens.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/sites/8/2017/12/glass-house-19.jpg 1500w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" /></p>
<p>If you haven&#8217;t already installed a new kitchen into your home, it&#8217;s likely that at this point you&#8217;ll start to notice what other things are wrong with your kitchen, and what you really want to change. This will give you the inspiration to start a plan of what you would like in your kitchen, and to start forming a design for your new room. A recent project we have just completed is our Redhill Kitchen, which is beautifully eclectic and makes a very bold statement despite the fact that it is an incredibly compact kitchen.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone wp-image-695 size-large" src="https://www.nakedkitchens.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/sites/8/2017/11/Redhill-30-1024x683.jpg" alt="" width="640" height="427" srcset="https://www.nakedkitchens.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/sites/8/2017/11/Redhill-30-1024x683.jpg 1024w, https://www.nakedkitchens.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/sites/8/2017/11/Redhill-30-300x200.jpg 300w, https://www.nakedkitchens.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/sites/8/2017/11/Redhill-30-768x512.jpg 768w, https://www.nakedkitchens.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/sites/8/2017/11/Redhill-30.jpg 1500w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" /><br />

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>We&#8217;re kicking off our latest series on the blog, which focuses on the use of colour, and with what is generally considered the biggest announcement in the colour world. This series will focus mainly on colour within the kitchen, but we will also look broadly at the latest trends in colour!</p>
<p><img src="https://www.designboom.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/pantone-color-of-the-year-2018-ultra-violet-designboom-1800.jpg" alt="Image result for pantone color of the year 2018" /></p>
<p><span id="more-770"></span></p>
<p>So December has come around incredibly quickly, and once again Pantone&#8217;s colour of the year has been announced, and it seems that this year the announcement is more controversial than ever! The colour of 2018- Ultra Violet- is described as: &#8216;Complex and contemplative, Ultra Violet suggests the mysteries of the cosmos, the intrigue of what lies ahead, and the discoveries beyond where we are now.&#8217;</p>
<p>Definitely a controversial choice from Pantone, and whilst it lies in the same &#8216;bright, jewel-like tones&#8217; as the 2017 colour of the year &#8216;Greenery&#8217;, this colour doesn&#8217;t make as much sense to a lot of interior specialists and bloggers. With Greenery being linked to nature, it was really quite easy to bring this into the household, whereas many are struggling to see where Pantone will fit into their homes.</p>
<p>A very bold colour that will definitely only work when used in a certain way, but it&#8217;s difficult to see this ever being used as the main colour of a room. With many describing this colour as incredibly similar to the purple used on Cadbury&#8217;s packaging, it&#8217;s possible that we may not see as much of this colour in 2018 interiors as we are used to with all of Pantone&#8217;s other colour choices.</p>
<p>This colour is bright and bold, and is also very different to the &#8216;rich, earthy&#8217; colours that we have been loving recently. But whilst we and many others remain quite sceptical for the moment, we&#8217;re certainly not ruling out the potential that Ultra Violet has, and we&#8217;re sure that it will actually look incredibly beautiful when used in the right way!<img class="alignnone wp-image-629 size-large" src="https://www.nakedkitchens.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/sites/8/2017/10/kia-designs-8-1024x666.jpg" alt="" width="640" height="416" srcset="https://www.nakedkitchens.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/sites/8/2017/10/kia-designs-8-1024x666.jpg 1024w, https://www.nakedkitchens.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/sites/8/2017/10/kia-designs-8-300x195.jpg 300w, https://www.nakedkitchens.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/sites/8/2017/10/kia-designs-8-768x500.jpg 768w, https://www.nakedkitchens.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/sites/8/2017/10/kia-designs-8.jpg 1500w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" /></p>
<p>At Naked Kitchens we&#8217;re particularly fond of using a bold colour in the kitchen. Our Highbury Kitchen uses the beautiful Dulux Storyteller to create a statement island in this colourful yet compact design. We particularly love the rich, jewel tones of the purple used and by using the colour on one element of the kitchen, this is a perfect way for people to inject Ultra Violet into their kitchens.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>One design element that we often recommend to our clients here at Naked Kitchens is to have a splashback in the kitchen. Splashbacks can be added as a feature in a beautiful kitchen, or as protection for walls from splashing pots and pans or taps, as they are often easily wipe able and easy to maintain. Some of our favourite kitchen designs we have ever created have splashbacks in them, and each looks completely unique in its own way, with the splashback adding an incredible eye catching feature.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone wp-image-639 size-large" src="https://www.nakedkitchens.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/sites/8/2017/10/brixton-6-683x1024.jpg" alt="" width="640" height="960" srcset="https://www.nakedkitchens.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/sites/8/2017/10/brixton-6-683x1024.jpg 683w, https://www.nakedkitchens.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/sites/8/2017/10/brixton-6-200x300.jpg 200w, https://www.nakedkitchens.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/sites/8/2017/10/brixton-6-768x1152.jpg 768w, https://www.nakedkitchens.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/sites/8/2017/10/brixton-6.jpg 1000w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" /></p>
<p><span id="more-634"></span></p>
<p>One of our most memorable designs, and also one of our most liked on social media is the Ladbroke Kitchen and its bronze splashback. An item that we created by hand, one evening in the directors kitchen no less, the bronze splashback has certainly gained some attention since we released the photos of this kitchen design. Antiqued by hand, every splashback we make is completely unique and made to order. So far, we have only experimented with this metal, but we are looking to incorporate other metals into our designs in the future. The bronze splashback combines beautifully with the other bronze elements within this design, and reflects light around the room, making it seem much larger than it is.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone wp-image-208 size-large" src="https://www.nakedkitchens.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/sites/8/2016/10/ladbrooke-2-683x1024.jpg" alt="" width="640" height="960" srcset="https://www.nakedkitchens.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/sites/8/2016/10/ladbrooke-2-683x1024.jpg 683w, https://www.nakedkitchens.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/sites/8/2016/10/ladbrooke-2-200x300.jpg 200w, https://www.nakedkitchens.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/sites/8/2016/10/ladbrooke-2-768x1152.jpg 768w, https://www.nakedkitchens.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/sites/8/2016/10/ladbrooke-2.jpg 1000w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" /></p>
<p>The antiqued foxed glass splashback in the Norfolk Vicarage Kitchen is especially fabulous. Behind the large stately AGA, this splashback makes a stunning statement. Despite being located in the area of the kitchen that has the least natural light and has the tendency to feel quite dark and closed off, the splashback actually reflects light from the beautiful garden, making the room feel open, spacious and incredibly light. A material that is potentially not the most practical, behind such a large source of heat, the glass will be easy to wipe and clean surface stains. The antiqued nature of the glass fits in perfectly with the traditional shaker kitchen in this listed building.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone wp-image-635 size-large" src="https://www.nakedkitchens.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/sites/8/2017/10/norfolk-vicarage-7-683x1024.jpg" alt="" width="640" height="960" srcset="https://www.nakedkitchens.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/sites/8/2017/10/norfolk-vicarage-7-683x1024.jpg 683w, https://www.nakedkitchens.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/sites/8/2017/10/norfolk-vicarage-7-200x300.jpg 200w, https://www.nakedkitchens.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/sites/8/2017/10/norfolk-vicarage-7-768x1152.jpg 768w, https://www.nakedkitchens.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/sites/8/2017/10/norfolk-vicarage-7.jpg 1000w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" /></p>
<p>This compact kitchen makes the most of its beautiful marble splashback. By having dark cabinetry and a very light coloured splashback and white wall cabinets, it keeps the eye-level of the kitchen bright and light, meaning it feels open and spacious, and never closed off, making the most of natural light. The Faraday Road kitchen is the perfect design for compact spaces. With minimal cabinetry, the marble splashback lends itself to making the statement for this kitchen design. Subtle and classic, this splashback isn&#8217;t ostentatious and doesn&#8217;t overpower such a small space. Matching the worktop, this splashback adds to the clean lines of the room and ensures everything remains sleek and sophisticated.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone wp-image-637 size-full" src="https://www.nakedkitchens.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/sites/8/2017/10/Faraday-Road-4.jpg" alt="" width="3600" height="2403" srcset="https://www.nakedkitchens.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/sites/8/2017/10/Faraday-Road-4.jpg 3600w, https://www.nakedkitchens.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/sites/8/2017/10/Faraday-Road-4-300x200.jpg 300w, https://www.nakedkitchens.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/sites/8/2017/10/Faraday-Road-4-768x513.jpg 768w, https://www.nakedkitchens.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/sites/8/2017/10/Faraday-Road-4-1024x684.jpg 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 3600px) 100vw, 3600px" /></p>
<p>The contrast in this kitchen is what makes this splashback work so well. Already a striking kitchen that makes a bold statement, the addition of the mottled grey tiles as a splashback makes this kitchen like no other. The Westbourne Gardens kitchen design is so unique, and whilst the splashback contrasts so dramatically, it actually works incredibly well. If you were to have a plainer, more simple splashback it would simply be lost against such bold cabinetry and handles, whereas you cannot deny this splashback instantly catches your eye. Easily cleaned and an incredibly durable material, these tiles add to the wondrous atmosphere of the room.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone wp-image-636 size-large" src="https://www.nakedkitchens.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/sites/8/2017/10/6-683x1024.jpg" alt="" width="640" height="960" srcset="https://www.nakedkitchens.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/sites/8/2017/10/6-683x1024.jpg 683w, https://www.nakedkitchens.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/sites/8/2017/10/6-200x300.jpg 200w, https://www.nakedkitchens.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/sites/8/2017/10/6-768x1152.jpg 768w, https://www.nakedkitchens.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/sites/8/2017/10/6.jpg 936w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" /><br />

<p>Finally, one of our more slightly more subtle designs but still incredibly stunning, is our Brancaster Marshes kitchen. The use of the antiqued glass as a splashback adds a beautiful element to this kitchen design, and ensures that light bounces around the room, making it feel bright and open. Having such a reflective splashback combined with floating shelves ensures that the room doesn&#8217;t feel like a sea of cabinetry. It keeps the eye-level of the room as light as possible, and also provides an interesting view for those sitting at the island. Glass is easy to clean but the antiqued nature of this particular piece means that you don&#8217;t have to worry about keeping it impossibly clean and smear-free.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>So we&#8217;re kicking off our latest series on this blog post with a post all about using brass in your kitchen in the most sophisticated and beautiful way. With a series of &#8216;mood board&#8217; images, you can see how we would incorporate brass into a kitchen design, and what other colours and timbers we would use to really maximise the statement this metal makes and create a beautiful kitchen. This particular combination was created by the creative director at Naked Kitchens, and is actually part of the inspiration behind one of our new showroom kitchens coming soon!</p>
<p><img class="alignnone wp-image-678 size-large" src="https://www.nakedkitchens.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/sites/8/2017/11/mood-board-2-1024x683.jpg" alt="" width="640" height="427" srcset="https://www.nakedkitchens.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/sites/8/2017/11/mood-board-2-1024x683.jpg 1024w, https://www.nakedkitchens.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/sites/8/2017/11/mood-board-2-300x200.jpg 300w, https://www.nakedkitchens.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/sites/8/2017/11/mood-board-2-768x512.jpg 768w, https://www.nakedkitchens.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/sites/8/2017/11/mood-board-2.jpg 1500w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" /></p>
<p><span id="more-674"></span><br />
Since creating our <a href="https://www.nakedkitchens.com/kitchens/frameless/ladbroke">Ladbroke</a> kitchen, we just can&#8217;t get enough of using antiqued brass splashbacks, and with good reason. They are simply stunning! As the brass splashback is such a feature element of any kitchen, we always recommend to keep the rest of the kitchen natural and earthy by using natural timbers and rich paint colours, to ensure the room never looks over the top despite the bright feature.</p>
<p>The contrast of the dark, sophisticated Walnut means that the brass can take centre stage in this design without fighting for attention. The metallic detailing would also flow throughout the kitchen with the sleek brass handles, which beautifully compliment the splashback and ensures the focus is never far from this metal. Brass also pairs incredibly well with the beautifully blue green paint sample, as it stands out much more than traditional silver or nickel handles would.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone wp-image-676 size-large" src="https://www.nakedkitchens.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/sites/8/2017/11/mood-board-5-1024x683.jpg" alt="" width="640" height="427" srcset="https://www.nakedkitchens.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/sites/8/2017/11/mood-board-5-1024x683.jpg 1024w, https://www.nakedkitchens.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/sites/8/2017/11/mood-board-5-300x200.jpg 300w, https://www.nakedkitchens.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/sites/8/2017/11/mood-board-5-768x512.jpg 768w, https://www.nakedkitchens.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/sites/8/2017/11/mood-board-5.jpg 1500w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" /></p>
<p>The beautifully moody paint colour seen in these photos is Livid by Little Green, and whilst it makes a statement against the sophisticated Walnut and brass accessories, it&#8217;s still subtle enough that it doesn&#8217;t overwhelm your senses, and still allows the bright brass to be the main feature.</p>
<p>You can see the beauty of the timber that we use in our kitchens, and understandably why our kitchens are such high quality, as we use ply as opposed to cheap chipboard. The incredible Walnut gives a sense of sophistication, whilst keeping the colour palette rich and earthy, which is insanely on trend at the moment. The addition of the Carrara Marble helps to keep the room bright and open, which is especially important in a compact room with minimal natural light.</p>
<p>Despite being a beautiful bright contrast to the dark Walnut in this design, the use of Brass as opposed to brighter metals like Gold or Silver actually adds to the softer tones of this design. As the brass splashback has been through an ageing process, it creates beautiful markings which are entirely unique to each piece of brass. This reinforces the bespoke element of a Naked Kitchen, as no kitchen will ever look the same.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone wp-image-677 size-large" src="https://www.nakedkitchens.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/sites/8/2017/11/mood-board-9-683x1024.jpg" alt="" width="640" height="960" srcset="https://www.nakedkitchens.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/sites/8/2017/11/mood-board-9-683x1024.jpg 683w, https://www.nakedkitchens.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/sites/8/2017/11/mood-board-9-200x300.jpg 200w, https://www.nakedkitchens.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/sites/8/2017/11/mood-board-9-768x1152.jpg 768w, https://www.nakedkitchens.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/sites/8/2017/11/mood-board-9.jpg 1000w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" /></p>
<p>We simply love these handles, not only for their subtle Brass colouring, but also for the beautiful grip element, which shows how our Kitchens are not only built for form, but function too.

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Something that most of our clients try to incorporate into their kitchen design, is an island. Whether it be a contemporary kitchen where the island is the main dining area, or a large country kitchen with a bold island design that is perfect for gathering around and socialising with drinks and friends. An island is often an integral part of a kitchen design and can make your room really stand out from the crowd. We&#8217;ve got a few favourites that we&#8217;ve designed over the years and we&#8217;d love to share them with you!</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter wp-image-366 size-large" src="https://www.nakedkitchens.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/sites/8/2017/07/cley-12-683x1024.jpg" alt="" width="640" height="960" srcset="https://www.nakedkitchens.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/sites/8/2017/07/cley-12-683x1024.jpg 683w, https://www.nakedkitchens.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/sites/8/2017/07/cley-12-200x300.jpg 200w, https://www.nakedkitchens.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/sites/8/2017/07/cley-12-768x1152.jpg 768w, https://www.nakedkitchens.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/sites/8/2017/07/cley-12.jpg 1000w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" /></p>
<p><span id="more-626"></span></p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.nakedkitchens.com/kitchens/naked-in-frame/cley">Cley Kitchen</a> is one of our beautifully traditional kitchen island designs. Situated in a large country kitchen, the island in this kitchen design is definitely the social point of the room. The perfect area for socialising with friends and drinks, or gathering children for a quick supper. An integrated wine fridge is in the perfect location to make this island incredibly practical, and the end grain work-surface is also incredibly hard wearing. With V-Groove panelling, the island ties the whole open plan room together, helping combine the cooking area with the rest of the kitchen that used dining and relaxing.</p>
<p><img class="wp-image-590 size-large aligncenter" src="https://www.nakedkitchens.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/sites/8/2017/10/brancaster-marshes-6-1024x683.jpg" alt="" width="640" height="427" srcset="https://www.nakedkitchens.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/sites/8/2017/10/brancaster-marshes-6-1024x683.jpg 1024w, https://www.nakedkitchens.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/sites/8/2017/10/brancaster-marshes-6-300x200.jpg 300w, https://www.nakedkitchens.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/sites/8/2017/10/brancaster-marshes-6-768x512.jpg 768w, https://www.nakedkitchens.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/sites/8/2017/10/brancaster-marshes-6.jpg 1500w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" /></p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.nakedkitchens.com/kitchens/frameless/brancaster-marshes">Brancaster Marshes</a> is one of our more contemporary kitchens, and the island is a very large feature point within this design. Perfect for family breakfasts or a relaxing cup of tea with friends in the afternoon, the island instantly grabs the eye as well as being incredibly functional too. With beautiful pendant lighting above, V-groove panelling painted to match other cabinetry within the room and exposed Oak work surfaces, and there is no denying the beauty of this island.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter wp-image-629 size-large" src="https://www.nakedkitchens.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/sites/8/2017/10/kia-designs-8-1024x666.jpg" alt="" width="640" height="416" srcset="https://www.nakedkitchens.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/sites/8/2017/10/kia-designs-8-1024x666.jpg 1024w, https://www.nakedkitchens.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/sites/8/2017/10/kia-designs-8-300x195.jpg 300w, https://www.nakedkitchens.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/sites/8/2017/10/kia-designs-8-768x500.jpg 768w, https://www.nakedkitchens.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/sites/8/2017/10/kia-designs-8.jpg 1500w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" /></p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.nakedkitchens.com/kitchens/frameless/highbury-kitchen">Highland Kitchen</a> is one of our more recent designs, and was focused around family living. Working with <a href="http://www.kiadesigns.co.uk/">Kia Designs</a>, the clients wanted a kitchen that would look incredibly beautiful, whilst being completely functional for a life with small children.</p>
<p>The island in this kitchen design is truly special, as it has a pop-up extractor and multi-burner hob included. This makes the island a focal point in the room and is the perfect place to serve food quickly, straight from the hob to those sitting at the island. Despite the room being relatively compact, by making the island also have a seating area means no space is lost, and the room doesn&#8217;t feel as though there is too much cabinetry. Having the island painted in a bold separate colour, contrasts to the white cabinetry in the room and makes a dramatic statement. <img class="aligncenter wp-image-594 size-full" src="https://www.nakedkitchens.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/sites/8/2017/10/Naked-Kitched-Gayton-5.jpg" alt="" width="750" height="501" srcset="https://www.nakedkitchens.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/sites/8/2017/10/Naked-Kitched-Gayton-5.jpg 750w, https://www.nakedkitchens.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/sites/8/2017/10/Naked-Kitched-Gayton-5-300x200.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 750px) 100vw, 750px" />Finally, the island in the <a href="https://www.nakedkitchens.com/kitchens/naked-in-frame/old-mill">Old Mill kitchen</a> is one of the more functional designs that we have created. With two integrated ovens, an induction hob and seating area, this island really is the perfect addition to a kitchen. The integrated appliances mean there are no bulky elements within the room, and everything looks sleek and sophisticated. By having the island in the middle of the room it allows the person cooking to remain involved with everyone in the room and not feel closed off. As a very clean, simple kitchen design, there are no bold, bright statements being made with this island, but simply functionality and form, showing off the beauty of V-Groove panelling.</p>
<p>If you have the space for an island within your kitchen, we would always recommend it, as it&#8217;s a beautiful area to gather, socialise, dine, drink and do so many things!
