				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>We&#8217;ve been busy here at Naked Kitchens getting to grips with the new trends and looks that are set to be popular in 2018. With the announcement of Dulux&#8217;s colour of 2018 Heartwood and Pantone releasing Ultra Violet as their chosen colour, it&#8217;s clear that purple will be involved within interiors this year. One of our creative kitchen designers created this mood board based around their favourite looks and much of the inspiration comes from what we&#8217;ve been designing with clients!</p>
<p><img class="alignnone wp-image-849 size-large" src="https://www.nakedkitchens.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/sites/8/2018/01/mood-board-3-1024x683.jpg" alt="" width="640" height="427" srcset="https://www.nakedkitchens.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/sites/8/2018/01/mood-board-3-1024x683.jpg 1024w, https://www.nakedkitchens.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/sites/8/2018/01/mood-board-3-300x200.jpg 300w, https://www.nakedkitchens.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/sites/8/2018/01/mood-board-3-768x512.jpg 768w, https://www.nakedkitchens.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/sites/8/2018/01/mood-board-3.jpg 1500w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" /></p>
<p><span id="more-847"></span></p>
<p>The use of heart wood as a colour is something that we&#8217;re absolutely loving seeing in kitchens at the moment. The beautiful pink tones in this colour work incredibly well with the oak and the marble within this combination and create a timeless colour palette.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone wp-image-848 size-large" src="https://www.nakedkitchens.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/sites/8/2018/01/mood-board-1-683x1024.jpg" alt="" width="640" height="960" srcset="https://www.nakedkitchens.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/sites/8/2018/01/mood-board-1-683x1024.jpg 683w, https://www.nakedkitchens.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/sites/8/2018/01/mood-board-1-200x300.jpg 200w, https://www.nakedkitchens.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/sites/8/2018/01/mood-board-1-768x1152.jpg 768w, https://www.nakedkitchens.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/sites/8/2018/01/mood-board-1.jpg 1000w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" /></p>
<p>By using darker accent colours it means that there is an additional depth to this design that gives a beautiful richness despite the natural feel of the collection. By using oak as the main timber choice it means that everything feels incredibly natural, and the whitewash finish ensures that the contemporary vibe isn&#8217;t lost and that everything is in-keeping with the cooler tones of the colours.</p>
<p>Despite the investment in colour in kitchens recently, we will always love grey in a kitchen, and we think it looks especially timeless and beautiful in a traditional shaker kitchen design. Recently we&#8217;ve seen examples of kitchens finished in a matte grey, and we think this is a beautiful way to have an updated version of a timeless neutral in your kitchen, and this works beautifully in a more contemporary, slab door style.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone wp-image-850 size-large" src="https://www.nakedkitchens.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/sites/8/2018/01/mood-board-4-1024x683.jpg" alt="" width="640" height="427" srcset="https://www.nakedkitchens.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/sites/8/2018/01/mood-board-4-1024x683.jpg 1024w, https://www.nakedkitchens.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/sites/8/2018/01/mood-board-4-300x200.jpg 300w, https://www.nakedkitchens.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/sites/8/2018/01/mood-board-4-768x512.jpg 768w, https://www.nakedkitchens.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/sites/8/2018/01/mood-board-4.jpg 1500w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" /></p>
<p>Using metals within your kitchen is still set to be very big 2018. With clients opting for brighter metals as a big feature in their kitchen such as copper and brass, there is no slowing down of the metallic trend this year. We are loving the use of copper within this design, as we think it really pops next to the white washed oak and the colours used, due to the bright, rose undertones.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone wp-image-851 size-large" src="https://www.nakedkitchens.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/sites/8/2018/01/mood-board-6-1024x683.jpg" alt="" width="640" height="427" srcset="https://www.nakedkitchens.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/sites/8/2018/01/mood-board-6-1024x683.jpg 1024w, https://www.nakedkitchens.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/sites/8/2018/01/mood-board-6-300x200.jpg 300w, https://www.nakedkitchens.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/sites/8/2018/01/mood-board-6-768x512.jpg 768w, https://www.nakedkitchens.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/sites/8/2018/01/mood-board-6.jpg 1500w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" /></p>
<p>Within this design the use of white accessories and marble helps to keep it clean a bright. Oak is generally a timber that can look quite warm and traditional, so by keeping everything else light and bright it ensures that this design will never look dated. White within a kitchen is never going to be out of fashion, so it is always a brilliant colour to bring into a design to keep it looking fresh.</p>
<p>We hope you enjoyed seeing what we&#8217;re loving in kitchens at the moment, and that it gave you some inspiration for your future kitchen!

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>2017 has definitely been the year for changing trends in kitchens. We&#8217;ve seen some incredibly beautiful trends throughout the year, but also a few that we&#8217;re happy to see never return!</p>
<p>Whilst we like to see all of the different interior trends throughout the year, we never create kitchens just to go along with those trends.Â We like to create kitchens that will stand the test of time and would never be considered a fad, so despite some of our kitchens being incredibly modern, they will never be out of fashion as they have so many timeless features within their designs. We have incorporated some trends into the designs we have created this year as we know they will last, but there are a few that we knew would be very short-lived. This post is simply a round up of our favourite trends from the past year, and we hope you enjoy re-living it with us!</p>
<p><img class="alignnone wp-image-456 size-large" src="https://www.nakedkitchens.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/sites/8/2017/08/brancaster-marshes-6-1024x683.jpg" alt="" width="640" height="427" srcset="https://www.nakedkitchens.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/sites/8/2017/08/brancaster-marshes-6-1024x683.jpg 1024w, https://www.nakedkitchens.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/sites/8/2017/08/brancaster-marshes-6-300x200.jpg 300w, https://www.nakedkitchens.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/sites/8/2017/08/brancaster-marshes-6-768x512.jpg 768w, https://www.nakedkitchens.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/sites/8/2017/08/brancaster-marshes-6.jpg 1500w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" /></p>
<p><span id="more-789"></span></p>
<p>One of the main trends of 2017 that we were fully supportive of is the mixing of materials within the kitchen. The kitchens we create for our clients are often finished in neutral colours, and therefore we like to try and incorporate another material into the design to ensure there is enough texture and warmth within the room.<br />
Mixing materials creates so many new textures for the eye to focus on, and ensures that the kitchen never feels flat or boring. As a company that specialises in using timber, we love to try and incorporate some form of exposed wood into the design. We particularly love the look of whitewashed oak in a neutral painted kitchen, as it brings a beautiful contemporary vibe to a neutral kitchen, without looking too cold or modern. Walnut is also a beautiful option for bringing warmth and sophistication to a kitchen, and mixes beautifully with a rich, intense colour palette.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone wp-image-208 size-large" src="https://www.nakedkitchens.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/sites/8/2016/10/ladbrooke-2-683x1024.jpg" alt="" width="640" height="960" srcset="https://www.nakedkitchens.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/sites/8/2016/10/ladbrooke-2-683x1024.jpg 683w, https://www.nakedkitchens.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/sites/8/2016/10/ladbrooke-2-200x300.jpg 200w, https://www.nakedkitchens.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/sites/8/2016/10/ladbrooke-2-768x1152.jpg 768w, https://www.nakedkitchens.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/sites/8/2016/10/ladbrooke-2.jpg 1000w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" /></p>
<p>Industrial style kitchens were also very popular in 2017, and this is actually set to continue into 2018 too. With the Scandi inspired trend of minimalism in a kitchen design, this has led to a lot of customers wanting to incorporate metal into their kitchen design, giving the kitchen an industrial vibe. We love the use of thin, black metal, as we think it contrasts beautifully with an exposed timber or painted kitchen. But, another trend that we have really got on board with is the use of warm metals in the kitchen. This can be done in a very subtle way, with handles or simple accessories, but we particularly love when metal is incorporated in a really bold way in the kitchen such as a splashback. One of our favourite (and our customers favourite) kitchen designs is our Ladbroke Kitchen, which has a large antiqued brass splashback, and is just absolutely stunning!</p>
<p><img class="alignnone wp-image-563 size-large" src="https://www.nakedkitchens.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/sites/8/2017/09/cley-2-683x1024.jpg" alt="" width="640" height="960" srcset="https://www.nakedkitchens.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/sites/8/2017/09/cley-2-683x1024.jpg 683w, https://www.nakedkitchens.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/sites/8/2017/09/cley-2-200x300.jpg 200w, https://www.nakedkitchens.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/sites/8/2017/09/cley-2-768x1152.jpg 768w, https://www.nakedkitchens.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/sites/8/2017/09/cley-2.jpg 1000w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" /></p>
<p>One trend we do love to see in kitchens is open shelving. Whilst wall cabinetry is absolutely beautiful, a lot of the kitchens we have designed recently are much more compact, we have to ensure we incorporate certain design featuresÂ to keep the room as light as possible. By using open shelving instead of wall cabinets, it means that the customer can still have storage within their compact room, but it never closes the room off. These open shelves also allow the client to put their own personal twist on their kitchen, as they can use these shelves to display their favourite items showing their visitors what they love.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone wp-image-207 size-large" src="https://www.nakedkitchens.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/sites/8/2016/10/ladbrooke-71-1024x683.jpg" alt="" width="640" height="427" srcset="https://www.nakedkitchens.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/sites/8/2016/10/ladbrooke-71-1024x683.jpg 1024w, https://www.nakedkitchens.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/sites/8/2016/10/ladbrooke-71-300x200.jpg 300w, https://www.nakedkitchens.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/sites/8/2016/10/ladbrooke-71-768x512.jpg 768w, https://www.nakedkitchens.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/sites/8/2016/10/ladbrooke-71.jpg 1500w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" /></p>
<p>Another favourite of 2017 kitchen trends was the use of a rich colour palette for cabinetry and walls. With many people choosing to break away from the normal neutrals that we see in so many kitchens, they were looking for alternatives that make an intense statement, but still look natural and not overwhelming in any way. We particularly love the look of dark greens and blues in a kitchen, but we&#8217;re sure there are many colours we&#8217;re going to see in 2018 that will make an incredible statement in the same way.<br />
We love when this colour palette is styled with some form of exposed timber, as we think these materials really compliment the rich colours and create an incredible relaxing vibe in the room.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone wp-image-564 size-large" src="https://www.nakedkitchens.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/sites/8/2017/09/cley-1-1024x683.jpg" alt="" width="640" height="427" srcset="https://www.nakedkitchens.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/sites/8/2017/09/cley-1-1024x683.jpg 1024w, https://www.nakedkitchens.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/sites/8/2017/09/cley-1-300x200.jpg 300w, https://www.nakedkitchens.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/sites/8/2017/09/cley-1-768x512.jpg 768w, https://www.nakedkitchens.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/sites/8/2017/09/cley-1.jpg 1500w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" /></p>
<p>Open plan living is something we saw many people try to incorporate into their kitchen design in 2017. With people looking to try and combine living, dining and cooking, and the kitchen becoming a very sociable gathering point for the whole family in the house, many clients are looking to make their kitchen into an area that incorporates all three.<br />
We use elements that we know can help to create a room of this style, such as large central island with seating for dining and socialising, or unique storage features such as bi-folding doors to hide TV&#8217;s to please all members of the family.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone wp-image-477 size-large" src="https://www.nakedkitchens.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/sites/8/2017/08/1-683x1024.jpg" alt="" width="640" height="960" srcset="https://www.nakedkitchens.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/sites/8/2017/08/1-683x1024.jpg 683w, https://www.nakedkitchens.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/sites/8/2017/08/1-200x300.jpg 200w, https://www.nakedkitchens.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/sites/8/2017/08/1-768x1152.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" /></p>
<p>Handle-less kitchen cabinetry is also a trend we&#8217;ve seen and wholly embraced in 2017. With many clients opting for a more contemporary kitchen for their modern home, a more sleek look has been embraced and handle-less cabinetry has been chosen. Whether this is the circular cut out detail like our Ladbroke Kitchen or the J-Groove handle on our Portobello Kitchen design, this handle-less detail ensures that the kitchen keeps its clean lines and contemporary feel.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone wp-image-379 size-large" src="https://www.nakedkitchens.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/sites/8/2017/08/Raynham-Larder-683x1024.jpg" alt="" width="640" height="960" srcset="https://www.nakedkitchens.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/sites/8/2017/08/Raynham-Larder-683x1024.jpg 683w, https://www.nakedkitchens.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/sites/8/2017/08/Raynham-Larder-200x300.jpg 200w, https://www.nakedkitchens.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/sites/8/2017/08/Raynham-Larder-768x1152.jpg 768w, https://www.nakedkitchens.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/sites/8/2017/08/Raynham-Larder.jpg 1000w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" /></p>
<p>Despite this not being a very exciting trend for 2017, the increase in people wanting to put bespoke storage solutions into their kitchens has been immense. With the popularity of larders and storage solutions that are completely bespoke to the customer such as engraved drawers, specially designed spice racks, and pull out caddies, there is no doubt that we have created pieces that perfectly fit with our customers lives. We&#8217;re not the only people who have noticed this trend however, with Houzz even writing anÂ <a href="https://www.houzz.co.uk/ideabooks/97841939/list/is-this-the-most-desirable-kitchen-feature-right-now">articleÂ </a>on larders being the most desirable kitchen feature of the moment!</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>We&#8217;re kicking off our latest series on the blog, which focuses on the use of colour, and with what is generally considered the biggest announcement in the colour world. This series will focus mainly on colour within the kitchen, but we will also look broadly at the latest trends in colour!</p>
<p><img src="https://www.designboom.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/pantone-color-of-the-year-2018-ultra-violet-designboom-1800.jpg" alt="Image result for pantone color of the year 2018" /></p>
<p><span id="more-770"></span></p>
<p>So December has come around incredibly quickly, and once again Pantone&#8217;s colour of the year has been announced, and it seems that this year the announcement is more controversial than ever! The colour of 2018-Â Ultra Violet- is described as: &#8216;Complex and contemplative, Ultra Violet suggests the mysteries of the cosmos, the intrigue of what lies ahead, and the discoveries beyond where we are now.&#8217;</p>
<p>Definitely a controversial choice from Pantone, and whilst it lies in the same &#8216;bright, jewel-like tones&#8217; as the 2017 colour of the year &#8216;Greenery&#8217;, this colour doesn&#8217;t make as much sense to a lot of interior specialists and bloggers. With Greenery being linked to nature, it was really quite easy to bring this into the household, whereas many are struggling to see where Pantone will fit into their homes.</p>
<p>A very bold colour that will definitely only work when used in a certain way, but it&#8217;s difficult to see this ever being used as the main colour of a room. With many describing this colour as incredibly similar to the purple used on Cadbury&#8217;s packaging, it&#8217;s possible that we may not see as much of this colour in 2018 interiors as we are used to with all of Pantone&#8217;s other colour choices.</p>
<p>This colour is bright and bold, and is also very different to the &#8216;rich, earthy&#8217; colours that we have been loving recently. But whilst we and many others remain quite sceptical for the moment, we&#8217;re certainly not ruling out the potential that Ultra Violet has, and we&#8217;re sure that it will actually look incredibly beautiful when used in the right way!<img class="alignnone wp-image-629 size-large" src="https://www.nakedkitchens.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/sites/8/2017/10/kia-designs-8-1024x666.jpg" alt="" width="640" height="416" srcset="https://www.nakedkitchens.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/sites/8/2017/10/kia-designs-8-1024x666.jpg 1024w, https://www.nakedkitchens.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/sites/8/2017/10/kia-designs-8-300x195.jpg 300w, https://www.nakedkitchens.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/sites/8/2017/10/kia-designs-8-768x500.jpg 768w, https://www.nakedkitchens.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/sites/8/2017/10/kia-designs-8.jpg 1500w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" /></p>
<p>At Naked Kitchens we&#8217;re particularly fond of using a bold colour in the kitchen. Our Highbury Kitchen uses the beautiful Dulux Storyteller to create a statement island in this colourful yet compact design. We particularly love the rich, jewel tones of the purple used and by using the colour on one element of the kitchen, this is a perfect way for people to inject Ultra Violet into their kitchens.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>2017 has certainly been the year for Naked Kitchens gaining awareness within the manufacturing industry,Â as not only have we been invited to contribute to this years Parliamentary Review for the Manufacturing Industry, but Naked Kitchens were also invited to speak about building and growing a successful business at the HSBC Strategies For Growth event!</p>
<p><img class="alignnone wp-image-733 size-full" src="https://www.nakedkitchens.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/sites/8/2017/11/parliamentary-review-badge.png" alt="" width="516" height="199" srcset="https://www.nakedkitchens.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/sites/8/2017/11/parliamentary-review-badge.png 516w, https://www.nakedkitchens.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/sites/8/2017/11/parliamentary-review-badge-300x116.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 516px) 100vw, 516px" /></p>
<p><span id="more-668"></span></p>
<p>As many of you may already know, Norfolk Oak is the parent company of Naked Kitchens, and is the inspiration behind our bespoke kitchen business. Norfolk Oak is a company that creates beautiful bespoke wooden worktops and custom furniture pieces, and are experts in woods and timber, knowing exactly how to get the best out of this beautiful material. Using timber from ethical, sustainable sources, there is no doubt that Norfolk Oak and Naked Kitchen&#8217;s products are miles in front of competitors in this industry.</p>
<p>Over time, Norfolk Oak have been recognised for the beautiful products they were creating, and it wasn&#8217;t long after building up this business that the requests came flooding in to create kitchens for people. After spending a small period of time developing the best way to create these kitchens for our clients, we developed Naked Kitchens, whom create bespoke kitchens at an incredibly fair and transparent price. Working on a manufacturing and supply basis only, both Norfolk Oak and Naked Kitchens provide an easy way to buy bespoke timber kitchens and products at lower prices considering the quality of the material used.Â One reason why Norfolk Oak and Naked Kitchens are able to do this, is becauseÂ we don&#8217;t have lots of ostentatious showrooms on the high street, and we work one location in Norfolk where all elements of our business work together under one roof, meaning we don&#8217;t have lots of overheads that we need to cover with our prices!</p>
<p>But the success and development of our businesses did not stop there. As with many other independent businesses, over time they often realise there is a proportion of the market that they are not successfully capturing. Naked Kitchens understood this, and developed Naked Doors, who manufacture the bespoke doors and drawer fronts that are seen on a Naked Kitchen. This enabled us to capture the proportion of the market who want a bespoke kitchen, but do not have the budget to renovate the whole kitchen, as these customers can place our bespoke doors and fronts onto their existing kitchen cabinets.Â There are many other projects in the pipeline for our companies, as we never want to stand-still and stagnate and are constantly trying to disrupt the industry with innovative products. Between the three current companies, there is an option to ensure that every person in the market can achieve some sort of designer look kitchen, whatever their situation or budget.<img class="alignnone" src="https://mail.google.com/mail/u/0?ui=2&amp;ik=33f29f0f64&amp;attid=0.3&amp;th=15fd8cc6575e317a&amp;view=fimg&amp;disp=thd&amp;attbid=ANGjdJ_e6KekEPG2U6BCzZYm8UTIL2iprvuiMoY_drc7502g2tZ8q_SUlKjpsPr3PMmXz1Qy8lgU_-82DaaKxoP_DYSmR0Efs64pgTm1VjXx2abFwk6Nu_w3-GDQfxM&amp;ats=2524608000000&amp;sz=w2538-h1277" alt="Displaying IMG_0645.JPG" width="1600" height="1200" /></p>
<p>So it is quite easy to see why Naked Kitchens was chosen. There is no doubt that as a company, we really have started at the beginning, and built up more than one successful company after discovering a niche gap within the market. A company built on impressive morals, they are FSC certified and create as minimal waste for the environment as possible, not only have the directors created such a successful business, they have done it ethically too.</p>
<p>As one of only two speakers at this event it is clear how special Naked Kitchens story really is. The event was invite only, and any business that was invited was chosen because they are dedicated to growing their company and HSBC knew that the Naked Kitchens success story is one that would inspire other companies to follow the same route.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>So we&#8217;re kicking off our latest series on this blog post with a post all about using brass in your kitchen in the most sophisticated and beautiful way. With a series of &#8216;mood board&#8217; images, you can see how we would incorporate brass into a kitchen design, and what other colours and timbers we would use to really maximise the statement this metal makes and create a beautiful kitchen. This particular combination was created by the creative director at Naked Kitchens, and is actually part of the inspiration behind one of our new showroom kitchens coming soon!</p>
<p><img class="alignnone wp-image-678 size-large" src="https://www.nakedkitchens.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/sites/8/2017/11/mood-board-2-1024x683.jpg" alt="" width="640" height="427" srcset="https://www.nakedkitchens.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/sites/8/2017/11/mood-board-2-1024x683.jpg 1024w, https://www.nakedkitchens.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/sites/8/2017/11/mood-board-2-300x200.jpg 300w, https://www.nakedkitchens.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/sites/8/2017/11/mood-board-2-768x512.jpg 768w, https://www.nakedkitchens.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/sites/8/2017/11/mood-board-2.jpg 1500w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" /></p>
<p><span id="more-674"></span><br />
Since creating our <a href="https://www.nakedkitchens.com/kitchens/frameless/ladbroke">Ladbroke</a> kitchen, we just can&#8217;t get enough of using antiqued brass splashbacks, and with good reason. They are simply stunning! As the brass splashback is such a feature element of any kitchen, we always recommend to keep the rest of the kitchen natural and earthy by using natural timbers and rich paint colours, to ensure the room never looks over the top despite the bright feature.</p>
<p>The contrast of the dark, sophisticated Walnut means that the brass can take centre stage in this design without fighting for attention. The metallic detailing would also flow throughout the kitchen with the sleek brass handles, which beautifully compliment the splashback and ensures the focus is never far from this metal. Brass also pairs incredibly well with the beautifully blue green paint sample, as it stands out much more than traditional silver or nickel handles would.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone wp-image-676 size-large" src="https://www.nakedkitchens.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/sites/8/2017/11/mood-board-5-1024x683.jpg" alt="" width="640" height="427" srcset="https://www.nakedkitchens.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/sites/8/2017/11/mood-board-5-1024x683.jpg 1024w, https://www.nakedkitchens.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/sites/8/2017/11/mood-board-5-300x200.jpg 300w, https://www.nakedkitchens.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/sites/8/2017/11/mood-board-5-768x512.jpg 768w, https://www.nakedkitchens.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/sites/8/2017/11/mood-board-5.jpg 1500w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" /></p>
<p>The beautifully moody paint colour seen in these photos is Livid by Little Green, and whilst it makes a statement against the sophisticated Walnut and brass accessories, it&#8217;s still subtle enough that it doesn&#8217;t overwhelm your senses, and still allows the bright brass to be the main feature.</p>
<p>You can see the beauty of the timber that we use in our kitchens, and understandably why our kitchens are such high quality, as we use ply as opposed to cheap chipboard. The incredible Walnut gives a sense of sophistication, whilst keeping the colour palette rich and earthy, which is insanely on trend at the moment. The addition of the Carrara Marble helps to keep the room bright and open, which is especially important in a compact room with minimal natural light.</p>
<p>Despite being a beautiful bright contrast to the dark Walnut in this design, the use of Brass as opposed to brighter metals like Gold or Silver actually adds to the softer tones of this design. As the brass splashback has been through an ageing process, it creates beautiful markings which are entirely unique to each piece of brass. This reinforces the bespoke element of a Naked Kitchen, as no kitchen will ever look the same.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone wp-image-677 size-large" src="https://www.nakedkitchens.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/sites/8/2017/11/mood-board-9-683x1024.jpg" alt="" width="640" height="960" srcset="https://www.nakedkitchens.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/sites/8/2017/11/mood-board-9-683x1024.jpg 683w, https://www.nakedkitchens.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/sites/8/2017/11/mood-board-9-200x300.jpg 200w, https://www.nakedkitchens.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/sites/8/2017/11/mood-board-9-768x1152.jpg 768w, https://www.nakedkitchens.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/sites/8/2017/11/mood-board-9.jpg 1000w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" /></p>
<p>We simply love these handles, not only for their subtle Brass colouring, but also for the beautiful grip element, which shows how our Kitchens are not only built for form, but function too.

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A highlight of 2017 that we haven&#8217;t yet shared with everyone is that Naked Kitchens has been invited to contribute to the 2017 <em>Parliamentary Review</em> for the Manufacturing Industry.</p>
<p>Sister company to Norfolk Oak, experts in solid hardwoods, Naked Kitchens are a leading manufacturer of fully bespoke kitchens. Until Naked Kitchens, the concept of an excellent bespoke product which more than challenged the very top end, but at a sensible price, was seen as unattainable. With the incredible reputation of Norfolk Oak behind it, the development of Naked Kitchens was the chance for a completely clean and fresh start, to really inject the industry with some new innovative thinking.Â We have a deep respect for the wood we use, a commitment to sustainable forestry and the crafting of long-lasting products with minimal waste.</p>
<p><img src="https://www.nakedkitchens.com/blog/images/2014-09/high-res.jpg" alt="land rover dropped on bespoke cabinets" /></p>
<p><span id="more-461"></span></p>
<p>The <em>Parliamentary Review</em> combines political commentary from leading journalists, with sector specific insight from Secretaries of State, Ministers and MP&#8217;s. It isÂ an indispensable guide to industry best practice, which demonstrates how sector leaders have responded to challenges in the political and economic environment.Â <em>The Parliamentary Review</em>Â is sent to over 250,000 leading business executives and policy-makers. In recent years, it has featured forewords by David Cameron, George Osborne and Philip Hammond.</p>
<p>Naked Kitchen&#8217;s contribution to the review highlights how Naked Kitchens have completely changed the kitchen marketplace by offering a high end quality product at a much lower price point, and also howÂ political instability can really impact a business. The owner of Naked Kitchens, Jamie Everett is absolutely delighted to have been invited to contribute to the review and delivers the message that &#8216;the real key to our success is to innovatively disrupt convention at every turn.&#8217;</p>
<p>The review is to be released in September 2017, and will be sent to thousands of business owners within the industry.Â The Review&#8217;s release is marked by an annual gala in the Palace of Westminster.</p>
