				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>We&#8217;ve been busy here at Naked Kitchens getting to grips with the new trends and looks that are set to be popular in 2018. With the announcement of Dulux&#8217;s colour of 2018 Heartwood and Pantone releasing Ultra Violet as their chosen colour, it&#8217;s clear that purple will be involved within interiors this year. One of our creative kitchen designers created this mood board based around their favourite looks and much of the inspiration comes from what we&#8217;ve been designing with clients!</p>
<p><img class="alignnone wp-image-849 size-large" src="https://www.nakedkitchens.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/sites/8/2018/01/mood-board-3-1024x683.jpg" alt="" width="640" height="427" srcset="https://www.nakedkitchens.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/sites/8/2018/01/mood-board-3-1024x683.jpg 1024w, https://www.nakedkitchens.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/sites/8/2018/01/mood-board-3-300x200.jpg 300w, https://www.nakedkitchens.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/sites/8/2018/01/mood-board-3-768x512.jpg 768w, https://www.nakedkitchens.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/sites/8/2018/01/mood-board-3.jpg 1500w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" /></p>
<p><span id="more-847"></span></p>
<p>The use of heart wood as a colour is something that we&#8217;re absolutely loving seeing in kitchens at the moment. The beautiful pink tones in this colour work incredibly well with the oak and the marble within this combination and create a timeless colour palette.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone wp-image-848 size-large" src="https://www.nakedkitchens.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/sites/8/2018/01/mood-board-1-683x1024.jpg" alt="" width="640" height="960" srcset="https://www.nakedkitchens.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/sites/8/2018/01/mood-board-1-683x1024.jpg 683w, https://www.nakedkitchens.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/sites/8/2018/01/mood-board-1-200x300.jpg 200w, https://www.nakedkitchens.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/sites/8/2018/01/mood-board-1-768x1152.jpg 768w, https://www.nakedkitchens.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/sites/8/2018/01/mood-board-1.jpg 1000w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" /></p>
<p>By using darker accent colours it means that there is an additional depth to this design that gives a beautiful richness despite the natural feel of the collection. By using oak as the main timber choice it means that everything feels incredibly natural, and the whitewash finish ensures that the contemporary vibe isn&#8217;t lost and that everything is in-keeping with the cooler tones of the colours.</p>
<p>Despite the investment in colour in kitchens recently, we will always love grey in a kitchen, and we think it looks especially timeless and beautiful in a traditional shaker kitchen design. Recently we&#8217;ve seen examples of kitchens finished in a matte grey, and we think this is a beautiful way to have an updated version of a timeless neutral in your kitchen, and this works beautifully in a more contemporary, slab door style.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone wp-image-850 size-large" src="https://www.nakedkitchens.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/sites/8/2018/01/mood-board-4-1024x683.jpg" alt="" width="640" height="427" srcset="https://www.nakedkitchens.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/sites/8/2018/01/mood-board-4-1024x683.jpg 1024w, https://www.nakedkitchens.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/sites/8/2018/01/mood-board-4-300x200.jpg 300w, https://www.nakedkitchens.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/sites/8/2018/01/mood-board-4-768x512.jpg 768w, https://www.nakedkitchens.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/sites/8/2018/01/mood-board-4.jpg 1500w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" /></p>
<p>Using metals within your kitchen is still set to be very big 2018. With clients opting for brighter metals as a big feature in their kitchen such as copper and brass, there is no slowing down of the metallic trend this year. We are loving the use of copper within this design, as we think it really pops next to the white washed oak and the colours used, due to the bright, rose undertones.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone wp-image-851 size-large" src="https://www.nakedkitchens.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/sites/8/2018/01/mood-board-6-1024x683.jpg" alt="" width="640" height="427" srcset="https://www.nakedkitchens.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/sites/8/2018/01/mood-board-6-1024x683.jpg 1024w, https://www.nakedkitchens.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/sites/8/2018/01/mood-board-6-300x200.jpg 300w, https://www.nakedkitchens.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/sites/8/2018/01/mood-board-6-768x512.jpg 768w, https://www.nakedkitchens.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/sites/8/2018/01/mood-board-6.jpg 1500w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" /></p>
<p>Within this design the use of white accessories and marble helps to keep it clean a bright. Oak is generally a timber that can look quite warm and traditional, so by keeping everything else light and bright it ensures that this design will never look dated. White within a kitchen is never going to be out of fashion, so it is always a brilliant colour to bring into a design to keep it looking fresh.</p>
<p>We hope you enjoyed seeing what we&#8217;re loving in kitchens at the moment, and that it gave you some inspiration for your future kitchen!

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>2017 has definitely been the year for changing trends in kitchens. We&#8217;ve seen some incredibly beautiful trends throughout the year, but also a few that we&#8217;re happy to see never return!</p>
<p>Whilst we like to see all of the different interior trends throughout the year, we never create kitchens just to go along with those trends. We like to create kitchens that will stand the test of time and would never be considered a fad, so despite some of our kitchens being incredibly modern, they will never be out of fashion as they have so many timeless features within their designs. We have incorporated some trends into the designs we have created this year as we know they will last, but there are a few that we knew would be very short-lived. This post is simply a round up of our favourite trends from the past year, and we hope you enjoy re-living it with us!</p>
<p><img class="alignnone wp-image-456 size-large" src="https://www.nakedkitchens.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/sites/8/2017/08/brancaster-marshes-6-1024x683.jpg" alt="" width="640" height="427" srcset="https://www.nakedkitchens.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/sites/8/2017/08/brancaster-marshes-6-1024x683.jpg 1024w, https://www.nakedkitchens.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/sites/8/2017/08/brancaster-marshes-6-300x200.jpg 300w, https://www.nakedkitchens.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/sites/8/2017/08/brancaster-marshes-6-768x512.jpg 768w, https://www.nakedkitchens.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/sites/8/2017/08/brancaster-marshes-6.jpg 1500w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" /></p>
<p><span id="more-789"></span></p>
<p>One of the main trends of 2017 that we were fully supportive of is the mixing of materials within the kitchen. The kitchens we create for our clients are often finished in neutral colours, and therefore we like to try and incorporate another material into the design to ensure there is enough texture and warmth within the room.<br />
Mixing materials creates so many new textures for the eye to focus on, and ensures that the kitchen never feels flat or boring. As a company that specialises in using timber, we love to try and incorporate some form of exposed wood into the design. We particularly love the look of whitewashed oak in a neutral painted kitchen, as it brings a beautiful contemporary vibe to a neutral kitchen, without looking too cold or modern. Walnut is also a beautiful option for bringing warmth and sophistication to a kitchen, and mixes beautifully with a rich, intense colour palette.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone wp-image-208 size-large" src="https://www.nakedkitchens.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/sites/8/2016/10/ladbrooke-2-683x1024.jpg" alt="" width="640" height="960" srcset="https://www.nakedkitchens.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/sites/8/2016/10/ladbrooke-2-683x1024.jpg 683w, https://www.nakedkitchens.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/sites/8/2016/10/ladbrooke-2-200x300.jpg 200w, https://www.nakedkitchens.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/sites/8/2016/10/ladbrooke-2-768x1152.jpg 768w, https://www.nakedkitchens.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/sites/8/2016/10/ladbrooke-2.jpg 1000w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" /></p>
<p>Industrial style kitchens were also very popular in 2017, and this is actually set to continue into 2018 too. With the Scandi inspired trend of minimalism in a kitchen design, this has led to a lot of customers wanting to incorporate metal into their kitchen design, giving the kitchen an industrial vibe. We love the use of thin, black metal, as we think it contrasts beautifully with an exposed timber or painted kitchen. But, another trend that we have really got on board with is the use of warm metals in the kitchen. This can be done in a very subtle way, with handles or simple accessories, but we particularly love when metal is incorporated in a really bold way in the kitchen such as a splashback. One of our favourite (and our customers favourite) kitchen designs is our Ladbroke Kitchen, which has a large antiqued brass splashback, and is just absolutely stunning!</p>
<p><img class="alignnone wp-image-563 size-large" src="https://www.nakedkitchens.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/sites/8/2017/09/cley-2-683x1024.jpg" alt="" width="640" height="960" srcset="https://www.nakedkitchens.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/sites/8/2017/09/cley-2-683x1024.jpg 683w, https://www.nakedkitchens.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/sites/8/2017/09/cley-2-200x300.jpg 200w, https://www.nakedkitchens.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/sites/8/2017/09/cley-2-768x1152.jpg 768w, https://www.nakedkitchens.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/sites/8/2017/09/cley-2.jpg 1000w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" /></p>
<p>One trend we do love to see in kitchens is open shelving. Whilst wall cabinetry is absolutely beautiful, a lot of the kitchens we have designed recently are much more compact, we have to ensure we incorporate certain design features to keep the room as light as possible. By using open shelving instead of wall cabinets, it means that the customer can still have storage within their compact room, but it never closes the room off. These open shelves also allow the client to put their own personal twist on their kitchen, as they can use these shelves to display their favourite items showing their visitors what they love.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone wp-image-207 size-large" src="https://www.nakedkitchens.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/sites/8/2016/10/ladbrooke-71-1024x683.jpg" alt="" width="640" height="427" srcset="https://www.nakedkitchens.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/sites/8/2016/10/ladbrooke-71-1024x683.jpg 1024w, https://www.nakedkitchens.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/sites/8/2016/10/ladbrooke-71-300x200.jpg 300w, https://www.nakedkitchens.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/sites/8/2016/10/ladbrooke-71-768x512.jpg 768w, https://www.nakedkitchens.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/sites/8/2016/10/ladbrooke-71.jpg 1500w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" /></p>
<p>Another favourite of 2017 kitchen trends was the use of a rich colour palette for cabinetry and walls. With many people choosing to break away from the normal neutrals that we see in so many kitchens, they were looking for alternatives that make an intense statement, but still look natural and not overwhelming in any way. We particularly love the look of dark greens and blues in a kitchen, but we&#8217;re sure there are many colours we&#8217;re going to see in 2018 that will make an incredible statement in the same way.<br />
We love when this colour palette is styled with some form of exposed timber, as we think these materials really compliment the rich colours and create an incredible relaxing vibe in the room.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone wp-image-564 size-large" src="https://www.nakedkitchens.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/sites/8/2017/09/cley-1-1024x683.jpg" alt="" width="640" height="427" srcset="https://www.nakedkitchens.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/sites/8/2017/09/cley-1-1024x683.jpg 1024w, https://www.nakedkitchens.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/sites/8/2017/09/cley-1-300x200.jpg 300w, https://www.nakedkitchens.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/sites/8/2017/09/cley-1-768x512.jpg 768w, https://www.nakedkitchens.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/sites/8/2017/09/cley-1.jpg 1500w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" /></p>
<p>Open plan living is something we saw many people try to incorporate into their kitchen design in 2017. With people looking to try and combine living, dining and cooking, and the kitchen becoming a very sociable gathering point for the whole family in the house, many clients are looking to make their kitchen into an area that incorporates all three.<br />
We use elements that we know can help to create a room of this style, such as large central island with seating for dining and socialising, or unique storage features such as bi-folding doors to hide TV&#8217;s to please all members of the family.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone wp-image-477 size-large" src="https://www.nakedkitchens.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/sites/8/2017/08/1-683x1024.jpg" alt="" width="640" height="960" srcset="https://www.nakedkitchens.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/sites/8/2017/08/1-683x1024.jpg 683w, https://www.nakedkitchens.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/sites/8/2017/08/1-200x300.jpg 200w, https://www.nakedkitchens.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/sites/8/2017/08/1-768x1152.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" /></p>
<p>Handle-less kitchen cabinetry is also a trend we&#8217;ve seen and wholly embraced in 2017. With many clients opting for a more contemporary kitchen for their modern home, a more sleek look has been embraced and handle-less cabinetry has been chosen. Whether this is the circular cut out detail like our Ladbroke Kitchen or the J-Groove handle on our Portobello Kitchen design, this handle-less detail ensures that the kitchen keeps its clean lines and contemporary feel.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone wp-image-379 size-large" src="https://www.nakedkitchens.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/sites/8/2017/08/Raynham-Larder-683x1024.jpg" alt="" width="640" height="960" srcset="https://www.nakedkitchens.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/sites/8/2017/08/Raynham-Larder-683x1024.jpg 683w, https://www.nakedkitchens.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/sites/8/2017/08/Raynham-Larder-200x300.jpg 200w, https://www.nakedkitchens.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/sites/8/2017/08/Raynham-Larder-768x1152.jpg 768w, https://www.nakedkitchens.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/sites/8/2017/08/Raynham-Larder.jpg 1000w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" /></p>
<p>Despite this not being a very exciting trend for 2017, the increase in people wanting to put bespoke storage solutions into their kitchens has been immense. With the popularity of larders and storage solutions that are completely bespoke to the customer such as engraved drawers, specially designed spice racks, and pull out caddies, there is no doubt that we have created pieces that perfectly fit with our customers lives. We&#8217;re not the only people who have noticed this trend however, with Houzz even writing an <a href="https://www.houzz.co.uk/ideabooks/97841939/list/is-this-the-most-desirable-kitchen-feature-right-now">article </a>on larders being the most desirable kitchen feature of the moment!</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>One design element that we often recommend to our clients here at Naked Kitchens is to have a splashback in the kitchen. Splashbacks can be added as a feature in a beautiful kitchen, or as protection for walls from splashing pots and pans or taps, as they are often easily wipe able and easy to maintain. Some of our favourite kitchen designs we have ever created have splashbacks in them, and each looks completely unique in its own way, with the splashback adding an incredible eye catching feature.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone wp-image-639 size-large" src="https://www.nakedkitchens.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/sites/8/2017/10/brixton-6-683x1024.jpg" alt="" width="640" height="960" srcset="https://www.nakedkitchens.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/sites/8/2017/10/brixton-6-683x1024.jpg 683w, https://www.nakedkitchens.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/sites/8/2017/10/brixton-6-200x300.jpg 200w, https://www.nakedkitchens.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/sites/8/2017/10/brixton-6-768x1152.jpg 768w, https://www.nakedkitchens.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/sites/8/2017/10/brixton-6.jpg 1000w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" /></p>
<p><span id="more-634"></span></p>
<p>One of our most memorable designs, and also one of our most liked on social media is the Ladbroke Kitchen and its bronze splashback. An item that we created by hand, one evening in the directors kitchen no less, the bronze splashback has certainly gained some attention since we released the photos of this kitchen design. Antiqued by hand, every splashback we make is completely unique and made to order. So far, we have only experimented with this metal, but we are looking to incorporate other metals into our designs in the future. The bronze splashback combines beautifully with the other bronze elements within this design, and reflects light around the room, making it seem much larger than it is.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone wp-image-208 size-large" src="https://www.nakedkitchens.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/sites/8/2016/10/ladbrooke-2-683x1024.jpg" alt="" width="640" height="960" srcset="https://www.nakedkitchens.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/sites/8/2016/10/ladbrooke-2-683x1024.jpg 683w, https://www.nakedkitchens.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/sites/8/2016/10/ladbrooke-2-200x300.jpg 200w, https://www.nakedkitchens.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/sites/8/2016/10/ladbrooke-2-768x1152.jpg 768w, https://www.nakedkitchens.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/sites/8/2016/10/ladbrooke-2.jpg 1000w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" /></p>
<p>The antiqued foxed glass splashback in the Norfolk Vicarage Kitchen is especially fabulous. Behind the large stately AGA, this splashback makes a stunning statement. Despite being located in the area of the kitchen that has the least natural light and has the tendency to feel quite dark and closed off, the splashback actually reflects light from the beautiful garden, making the room feel open, spacious and incredibly light. A material that is potentially not the most practical, behind such a large source of heat, the glass will be easy to wipe and clean surface stains. The antiqued nature of the glass fits in perfectly with the traditional shaker kitchen in this listed building.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone wp-image-635 size-large" src="https://www.nakedkitchens.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/sites/8/2017/10/norfolk-vicarage-7-683x1024.jpg" alt="" width="640" height="960" srcset="https://www.nakedkitchens.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/sites/8/2017/10/norfolk-vicarage-7-683x1024.jpg 683w, https://www.nakedkitchens.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/sites/8/2017/10/norfolk-vicarage-7-200x300.jpg 200w, https://www.nakedkitchens.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/sites/8/2017/10/norfolk-vicarage-7-768x1152.jpg 768w, https://www.nakedkitchens.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/sites/8/2017/10/norfolk-vicarage-7.jpg 1000w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" /></p>
<p>This compact kitchen makes the most of its beautiful marble splashback. By having dark cabinetry and a very light coloured splashback and white wall cabinets, it keeps the eye-level of the kitchen bright and light, meaning it feels open and spacious, and never closed off, making the most of natural light. The Faraday Road kitchen is the perfect design for compact spaces. With minimal cabinetry, the marble splashback lends itself to making the statement for this kitchen design. Subtle and classic, this splashback isn&#8217;t ostentatious and doesn&#8217;t overpower such a small space. Matching the worktop, this splashback adds to the clean lines of the room and ensures everything remains sleek and sophisticated.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone wp-image-637 size-full" src="https://www.nakedkitchens.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/sites/8/2017/10/Faraday-Road-4.jpg" alt="" width="3600" height="2403" srcset="https://www.nakedkitchens.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/sites/8/2017/10/Faraday-Road-4.jpg 3600w, https://www.nakedkitchens.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/sites/8/2017/10/Faraday-Road-4-300x200.jpg 300w, https://www.nakedkitchens.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/sites/8/2017/10/Faraday-Road-4-768x513.jpg 768w, https://www.nakedkitchens.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/sites/8/2017/10/Faraday-Road-4-1024x684.jpg 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 3600px) 100vw, 3600px" /></p>
<p>The contrast in this kitchen is what makes this splashback work so well. Already a striking kitchen that makes a bold statement, the addition of the mottled grey tiles as a splashback makes this kitchen like no other. The Westbourne Gardens kitchen design is so unique, and whilst the splashback contrasts so dramatically, it actually works incredibly well. If you were to have a plainer, more simple splashback it would simply be lost against such bold cabinetry and handles, whereas you cannot deny this splashback instantly catches your eye. Easily cleaned and an incredibly durable material, these tiles add to the wondrous atmosphere of the room.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone wp-image-636 size-large" src="https://www.nakedkitchens.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/sites/8/2017/10/6-683x1024.jpg" alt="" width="640" height="960" srcset="https://www.nakedkitchens.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/sites/8/2017/10/6-683x1024.jpg 683w, https://www.nakedkitchens.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/sites/8/2017/10/6-200x300.jpg 200w, https://www.nakedkitchens.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/sites/8/2017/10/6-768x1152.jpg 768w, https://www.nakedkitchens.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/sites/8/2017/10/6.jpg 936w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" /><br />

<p>Finally, one of our more slightly more subtle designs but still incredibly stunning, is our Brancaster Marshes kitchen. The use of the antiqued glass as a splashback adds a beautiful element to this kitchen design, and ensures that light bounces around the room, making it feel bright and open. Having such a reflective splashback combined with floating shelves ensures that the room doesn&#8217;t feel like a sea of cabinetry. It keeps the eye-level of the room as light as possible, and also provides an interesting view for those sitting at the island. Glass is easy to clean but the antiqued nature of this particular piece means that you don&#8217;t have to worry about keeping it impossibly clean and smear-free.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Something that most of our clients try to incorporate into their kitchen design, is an island. Whether it be a contemporary kitchen where the island is the main dining area, or a large country kitchen with a bold island design that is perfect for gathering around and socialising with drinks and friends. An island is often an integral part of a kitchen design and can make your room really stand out from the crowd. We&#8217;ve got a few favourites that we&#8217;ve designed over the years and we&#8217;d love to share them with you!</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter wp-image-366 size-large" src="https://www.nakedkitchens.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/sites/8/2017/07/cley-12-683x1024.jpg" alt="" width="640" height="960" srcset="https://www.nakedkitchens.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/sites/8/2017/07/cley-12-683x1024.jpg 683w, https://www.nakedkitchens.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/sites/8/2017/07/cley-12-200x300.jpg 200w, https://www.nakedkitchens.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/sites/8/2017/07/cley-12-768x1152.jpg 768w, https://www.nakedkitchens.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/sites/8/2017/07/cley-12.jpg 1000w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" /></p>
<p><span id="more-626"></span></p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.nakedkitchens.com/kitchens/naked-in-frame/cley">Cley Kitchen</a> is one of our beautifully traditional kitchen island designs. Situated in a large country kitchen, the island in this kitchen design is definitely the social point of the room. The perfect area for socialising with friends and drinks, or gathering children for a quick supper. An integrated wine fridge is in the perfect location to make this island incredibly practical, and the end grain work-surface is also incredibly hard wearing. With V-Groove panelling, the island ties the whole open plan room together, helping combine the cooking area with the rest of the kitchen that used dining and relaxing.</p>
<p><img class="wp-image-590 size-large aligncenter" src="https://www.nakedkitchens.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/sites/8/2017/10/brancaster-marshes-6-1024x683.jpg" alt="" width="640" height="427" srcset="https://www.nakedkitchens.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/sites/8/2017/10/brancaster-marshes-6-1024x683.jpg 1024w, https://www.nakedkitchens.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/sites/8/2017/10/brancaster-marshes-6-300x200.jpg 300w, https://www.nakedkitchens.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/sites/8/2017/10/brancaster-marshes-6-768x512.jpg 768w, https://www.nakedkitchens.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/sites/8/2017/10/brancaster-marshes-6.jpg 1500w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" /></p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.nakedkitchens.com/kitchens/frameless/brancaster-marshes">Brancaster Marshes</a> is one of our more contemporary kitchens, and the island is a very large feature point within this design. Perfect for family breakfasts or a relaxing cup of tea with friends in the afternoon, the island instantly grabs the eye as well as being incredibly functional too. With beautiful pendant lighting above, V-groove panelling painted to match other cabinetry within the room and exposed Oak work surfaces, and there is no denying the beauty of this island.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter wp-image-629 size-large" src="https://www.nakedkitchens.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/sites/8/2017/10/kia-designs-8-1024x666.jpg" alt="" width="640" height="416" srcset="https://www.nakedkitchens.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/sites/8/2017/10/kia-designs-8-1024x666.jpg 1024w, https://www.nakedkitchens.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/sites/8/2017/10/kia-designs-8-300x195.jpg 300w, https://www.nakedkitchens.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/sites/8/2017/10/kia-designs-8-768x500.jpg 768w, https://www.nakedkitchens.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/sites/8/2017/10/kia-designs-8.jpg 1500w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" /></p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.nakedkitchens.com/kitchens/frameless/highbury-kitchen">Highland Kitchen</a> is one of our more recent designs, and was focused around family living. Working with <a href="http://www.kiadesigns.co.uk/">Kia Designs</a>, the clients wanted a kitchen that would look incredibly beautiful, whilst being completely functional for a life with small children.</p>
<p>The island in this kitchen design is truly special, as it has a pop-up extractor and multi-burner hob included. This makes the island a focal point in the room and is the perfect place to serve food quickly, straight from the hob to those sitting at the island. Despite the room being relatively compact, by making the island also have a seating area means no space is lost, and the room doesn&#8217;t feel as though there is too much cabinetry. Having the island painted in a bold separate colour, contrasts to the white cabinetry in the room and makes a dramatic statement. <img class="aligncenter wp-image-594 size-full" src="https://www.nakedkitchens.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/sites/8/2017/10/Naked-Kitched-Gayton-5.jpg" alt="" width="750" height="501" srcset="https://www.nakedkitchens.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/sites/8/2017/10/Naked-Kitched-Gayton-5.jpg 750w, https://www.nakedkitchens.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/sites/8/2017/10/Naked-Kitched-Gayton-5-300x200.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 750px) 100vw, 750px" />Finally, the island in the <a href="https://www.nakedkitchens.com/kitchens/naked-in-frame/old-mill">Old Mill kitchen</a> is one of the more functional designs that we have created. With two integrated ovens, an induction hob and seating area, this island really is the perfect addition to a kitchen. The integrated appliances mean there are no bulky elements within the room, and everything looks sleek and sophisticated. By having the island in the middle of the room it allows the person cooking to remain involved with everyone in the room and not feel closed off. As a very clean, simple kitchen design, there are no bold, bright statements being made with this island, but simply functionality and form, showing off the beauty of V-Groove panelling.</p>
<p>If you have the space for an island within your kitchen, we would always recommend it, as it&#8217;s a beautiful area to gather, socialise, dine, drink and do so many things!

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>It’s early o’clock, dew still on the ground, but Naked Kitchens creative director Jayne Everett and photographer Malcolm Menzies are already hard at work on their photoshoot in deepest Norfolk.  You couldn’t make up a more idyllic setting for someone’s dream country kitchen  &#8211;  an old vicarage in the heart of the Broads.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-280" src="https://www.nakedkitchens.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/sites/8/2017/06/norfolk-vicarige-2.jpg" alt="" width="1000" height="1500" srcset="https://www.nakedkitchens.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/sites/8/2017/06/norfolk-vicarige-2.jpg 1000w, https://www.nakedkitchens.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/sites/8/2017/06/norfolk-vicarige-2-200x300.jpg 200w, https://www.nakedkitchens.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/sites/8/2017/06/norfolk-vicarige-2-768x1152.jpg 768w, https://www.nakedkitchens.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/sites/8/2017/06/norfolk-vicarige-2-683x1024.jpg 683w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /><span id="more-274"></span></p>
<p>But it&#8217;s all real. Real house, real homeowners, real Naked Kitchen. Our very latest, to be precise, commissioned by a busy professional couple who love to cook and who entertain like it&#8217;s going out of fashion.  The kitchen  – no prizes for guessing that we’re calling it The Norfolk Vicarage &#8211;  is spacy and breezy, spritzing the innocence of the Shaker classic with a chilled new twist.</p>
<p>If anyone can shoot this breeziness to show off the kitchen in all its brilliance, then it’s award-winning Malcolm. He’s the ideal lensman for Naked Kitchens, completely grasping the earthy yet edgy ethos underlying our work, our respect for wood and our way of harnessing hi-tech to use natural materials sustainably and without waste. Hailing from the remote island of Iona, Malcolm is no stranger to the wild side, although he’s now based in London with a reputation for catching some of the capital’s most iconic and sophisticated brands, interiors and lifestyles.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-281" src="https://www.nakedkitchens.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/sites/8/2017/06/norfolk-vicarige-3.jpg" alt="" width="1500" height="1399" srcset="https://www.nakedkitchens.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/sites/8/2017/06/norfolk-vicarige-3.jpg 1500w, https://www.nakedkitchens.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/sites/8/2017/06/norfolk-vicarige-3-300x280.jpg 300w, https://www.nakedkitchens.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/sites/8/2017/06/norfolk-vicarige-3-768x716.jpg 768w, https://www.nakedkitchens.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/sites/8/2017/06/norfolk-vicarige-3-1024x955.jpg 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 1500px) 100vw, 1500px" /></p>
<p>We’re proud of The Norfolk Vicarage and we can’t wait to see how Malcolm’s artistry reveals its personality. So much heart and soul gets poured into creating our kitchens, and launching any one of them is a huge deal.   Suddenly, we’re seeing the kitchen through someone else’s eyes and it’s exciting and nerve-wracking all at the same time.</p>
<p>As the Norfolk Vicarage couple love entertaining so much, their new kitchen was crafted to be the very hub of the home, offering both welcome and wow factor to their many guests. In a svelte fusion of ancient and modern, we worked around period features like the chimney breast and narrow windows to bring the necessary fluency and circulation to an area that is often both entrance and living room of the house.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-282" src="https://www.nakedkitchens.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/sites/8/2017/06/norfolk-vicarige-before-after.jpg" alt="" width="1500" height="1125" srcset="https://www.nakedkitchens.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/sites/8/2017/06/norfolk-vicarige-before-after.jpg 1500w, https://www.nakedkitchens.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/sites/8/2017/06/norfolk-vicarige-before-after-300x225.jpg 300w, https://www.nakedkitchens.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/sites/8/2017/06/norfolk-vicarige-before-after-768x576.jpg 768w, https://www.nakedkitchens.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/sites/8/2017/06/norfolk-vicarige-before-after-1024x768.jpg 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 1500px) 100vw, 1500px" /></p>
<p>It all came together smoothly &#8211; and what was once a rather dark space is now bright and joyous, with a stunning sweep of antiqued glass behind the Aga spreading its radiance over worktops of white Carrara quartz and giving a friendly sparkle to the carefully-positioned glazed cabinets</p>
<p>It’s a kitchen with all kinds of tailored elegance:  putting the cocktails in Shaker, we love the host’s area with its smart little sink &#8211; for icing and slicing the G&amp;Ts &#8211;  a glasses cupboard, and cabinet for storing wine and mixers.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-279" src="https://www.nakedkitchens.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/sites/8/2017/06/norfolk-vicarige-1.jpg" alt="home cocktail bar" width="1055" height="1500" srcset="https://www.nakedkitchens.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/sites/8/2017/06/norfolk-vicarige-1.jpg 1055w, https://www.nakedkitchens.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/sites/8/2017/06/norfolk-vicarige-1-211x300.jpg 211w, https://www.nakedkitchens.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/sites/8/2017/06/norfolk-vicarige-1-768x1092.jpg 768w, https://www.nakedkitchens.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/sites/8/2017/06/norfolk-vicarige-1-720x1024.jpg 720w" sizes="(max-width: 1055px) 100vw, 1055px" /></p>
<p>There are stowaway trays of sleek grained wood, pegboard crockery dividers in the solid oak drawers, a vegetable preparation sink, cupboards with bifold doors that open generously to the full depth of the worktop, and a deep overhang on the island, allowing friends to lean in comfortably, instead of perching awkwardly on their stools with nowhere to put their knees.</p>
<p>The photoshoot takes about ten hours, but it’s fascinating to glimpse how Malcolm’s keen eye picks angles and lighting that catch the essence of this lovely new kitchen.  We can’t wait to launch it now – so, as they say, watch this space.  Or rather, the fresh new space of The Norfolk Vicarage Kitchen….</p>
