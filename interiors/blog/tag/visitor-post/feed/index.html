				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>What is a Bespoke Kitchen?<br />
</strong>Re-designing a space can be difficult enough without having the added worry of cost, function, and depreciation. But unlike picking the wrong colour sofa cushions or curtains that clash with the wallpaper, a kitchen is a little harder to change once you&#8217;ve committed!<br />
Purchasing a new kitchen for your home is a very big decision, and nobody wants to be left with a kitchen they don&#8217;t truly love every part of. At Naked Kitchens this won&#8217;t happen, as we will always go the extra step to ensure you love every single detail of your design before the material has even been cut!<br />
A bespoke kitchen is one that is entirely unique to each and every client. There is no standard sizing, and whilst we have kitchen designs that can be followed for inspiration, we can create completely unique designs for every customer. We use the finest natural resources to produce beautiful, sturdy and timeless kitchen cabinetry. With the choice of any fascia colour or exposed natural timber to complement all tastes, we guarantee pure kitchen love.</p>

<p><span id="more-656"></span></p>
<p><strong>But what does it really mean to have a bespoke kitchen?</strong></p>
<p>Contrary to some opinions, a truly bespoke kitchen is 100% tailor-made and designed for the client. Whilst some kitchen companies claim to be fully bespoke, the reality is that they simply offer different pre-determined options and limit the customers to standard sizes. Unlike these manufacturers, Naked Kitchens offer a fully bespoke service. Whilst other kitchen manufacturers stockpile kitchen cabinets in standard sizes, we will not even cut our materials until your tailor-made kitchen design is exactly as you want it. This not only ensures a reduction in waste material but it also means you get your dream kitchen that is the perfect size!</p>
<p><img class="alignnone wp-image-208 size-large" src="https://www.nakedkitchens.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/sites/8/2016/10/ladbrooke-2-683x1024.jpg" alt="" width="640" height="960" srcset="https://www.nakedkitchens.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/sites/8/2016/10/ladbrooke-2-683x1024.jpg 683w, https://www.nakedkitchens.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/sites/8/2016/10/ladbrooke-2-200x300.jpg 200w, https://www.nakedkitchens.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/sites/8/2016/10/ladbrooke-2-768x1152.jpg 768w, https://www.nakedkitchens.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/sites/8/2016/10/ladbrooke-2.jpg 1000w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" /></p>
<p><strong>So how do we create a truly bespoke kitchen?</strong></p>
<p>We offer a design service for our clients, as we like to get to know our customers tastes and preferences, as well as asking for a room plan for the space so that we know the dimensions we are working with. From creating custom built beautiful larders to developing clever storage solutions to hide bulky appliances, everything we create is truly bespoke. With the technology that we have invested in we are able to take the design we have created on the screen, straight to our cutting machines. This means that we can get the bespoke kitchen to you much quicker, whilst creating minimal waste too.</p>

<p>To us, working with just standard cabinet size or configurations will completely limit all creativity when designing a kitchen. Creating a standard kitchen is just not in our nature. Whilst some elements of a kitchen will always remain the same, such as the need for a sink and cooker, we will never limit you on having typical 600 x 800 cabinets throughout, nor will we restrict you on the formation within, with many bespoke internal features available.<br />
We also offer a range of options when it comes to splash-backs, appliances, and other aesthetics such as handles, and can help you to source light fixtures and other features for your kitchen. As a Miele Partner, there is no need to shop elsewhere for appliances as we can source Miele appliances for you.</p>
